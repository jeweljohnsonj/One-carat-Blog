## Distribution and variance

Let us look at the `penguins` dataset from the `{palmerpenguins}` package in R. We will plot the distribution curve for "body mass" of the "Chinstrap" species of penguins.

```{r}
#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins %>% filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>% ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g)) + 
  xlab("Body Mass (g)") + ylab("Density") + ggtitle("Body mass distribution") + 
  geom_density(fill = "darkred") + 
  labs(subtitle = paste0("N=",penguins %>% filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>% nrow())) +
  theme_bw()
```

As you can see, the data distribution closely resembles a "bell-shaped" curve. This kind of distribution is known as a `normal distribution` or a `Gaussian distribution`. On closer look you can also see that the area under the curve is almost symmetrical to both sides and there is only a single peak present. We can also learn about the `variance` of the data by looking at the width of the curve. A wider curve means variance is higher and a narrower curve means variance in the data is smaller. Also for a normal distribution, there are no visible outliers present in the plot. The peak represents the `mean` of the data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

# Create function to get mode
getmode <- function(v) {
   uniqv <- unique(v)
   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}

pen_avg <- penguins %>% filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>% summarise(mean = mean(body_mass_g),
                                                          median = median(body_mass_g),
                                                          mode = getmode(body_mass_g))

penguins %>% filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g)) + 
  xlab("Body Mass (g)") + ylab("Density") + ggtitle("Body mass distribution") + 
  geom_density(fill = "grey") + 
  labs(subtitle = paste0("N=",penguins %>% filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>% nrow())) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = pen_avg$mean, colour = "red")) +
  geom_text(aes(x=pen_avg$mean, label="mean", y=4e-04), colour="red", angle=90, vjust = 1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = pen_avg$median, colour = "blue")) +
  geom_text(aes(x=pen_avg$median, label="median", y=4e-04), colour="blue", angle=90, vjust = -1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +
geom_vline(aes(xintercept = pen_avg$mode, colour = "green")) +
  geom_text(aes(x=pen_avg$mode, label="mode", y=4e-04), colour="green", angle=90, vjust = -1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +
  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position="none")
```

For a normal distribution the `mean`, `median` and `mode` are all the same value and are in the middle of the curve. From the plot above you can see that all the averages are almost the same. In general all three modes of averages tries to represent the centre of the dataset for any distribution. With that said some mode of average is preferred over others in terms of the nature of the distribution, we will see what it means later on.

Now let us look the same distribution but for "Gentoo" species of penguins.

```{r}
#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins %>% filter(species == "Gentoo") %>% ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g)) + 
  xlab("Body Mass (g)") + ylab("Density") + ggtitle("Body mass distribution") + 
  geom_density(fill = "darkblue") + 
  labs(subtitle = paste0("N=",penguins %>% filter(species == "Gentoo") %>% nrow())) +
  theme_bw()
```

Unlike the previous curve this one clearly has two peaks. This kind of curve is an example of "bimodal distribution". Now what caused these two peaks to form in this one but not in the first one? So we can guess that there is some hidden variable that is affecting the body mass distribution of Gentoo penguins. What about the 'sex' of the penguins? Will that have any effect? Let us try plotting the same plot but in terms of 'sex' of the penguins.

```{r}
#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins %>% filter(species == "Gentoo") %>% drop_na() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = sex)) + 
  xlab("Body Mass (g)") + ylab("Density") + ggtitle("Body mass distribution") + 
  geom_density() + 
  labs(subtitle = paste0("N=",penguins %>% filter(species == "Gentoo") %>% nrow())) +
  theme_bw()
```

Ha! We were spot on! So it looks like male Gentoos are generally larger in comparison to females.

Now let us consider the plot given below.

```{r}
#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

diamonds %>% filter(cut == "Fair") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat)) + 
  xlab("carats") + ylab("Density") + ggtitle("Diamond carat distribution") + 
  geom_density(fill = "gold") + 
  labs(subtitle = paste0("N=",diamonds %>% filter(cut == "Fair") %>% nrow())) +
  theme_bw()
```

This is an example of a "skewed distribution". Moreover this is a "right-skewed distribution", why is it called right-skewed? Look at the same plot below.

```{r}
#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

# Create function to get mode
getmode <- function(v) {
   uniqv <- unique(v)
   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}

diamonds %>% filter(cut == "Fair") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat)) + 
  xlab("carats") + ylab("Density") + ggtitle("Diamond carat distribution") + 
  geom_density(fill = "gold") + 
  labs(subtitle = paste0("N=",diamonds %>% filter(cut == "Fair") %>% nrow())) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(diamonds$carat), colour = "red")) +
  geom_text(aes(x=mean(diamonds$carat), label="mean", y=1), colour="red", angle=90, vjust = 1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(diamonds$carat), colour = "blue")) +
  geom_text(aes(x=median(diamonds$carat), label="median", y=1), colour="blue", angle=90, vjust = -1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +
geom_vline(aes(xintercept = getmode(diamonds$carat), colour = "green")) +
  geom_text(aes(x=getmode(diamonds$carat), label="mode", y=1), colour="green", angle=90, vjust = -1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +
  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position="none")
```

I have plotted the mean, median and mode values for the plot and you can see that the mean value is more that the mode value. This is why the curve is indicated as right-skewed, as the mean is skewed towards the right side of the mode value. If it was the other way around then the curve will be called "left-skewed". Also in this case if we had used mean value to represent the dataset it would have been a poor choice and you clearly see that median is better choice compared to mean. Therefore when the dataset is skewed, median is better choice to represent the dataset. Mode will be best suited for datasets with lot of repeated values.

## Variance

Variance of a data is defined as the average of squared difference from the mean of the data. Basically it tell us how far each of our data points are from the mean value.

[![Fig2: Variance in distributions. Credits: https://access-excel.tips/](http://cdn-0.access-excel.tips/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/variability.gif)](https://access-excel.tips/excel-range-variance-standard-deviation/)

The formula for finding the variance is as follows;

$$s^{2} = \frac{\sum (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2}}{N - 1}$$

Where $s^{2}$ is `variance`, $x_{i}$ is your data point, $\bar{x}$ is mean and $N$ is the sample size.

For sufficiently large value of $N$, the equation for variance will become;

$$\sigma^{2} = \frac{\sum (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2}}{N}$$ where $\sigma^{2}$ is called `population variance`.

Further more $\sigma$ is called as the `standard deviation` of the data which we will see in detail later.
