## Type I error

Type I error happens when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. It is also called as 'false-positive'. The chance of type I error to occur is determined by the level of significance($\alpha$) that we set prior to our experiments. Generally $\alpha$ is set at a value of 0.05. Like previously mentioned, at this value, there is a 5% chance that the observed results or more extreme results to occur, given that the null hypothesis is true. At lower values of $\alpha$, the chance of type I error to occur reduces.

## Type II error

Type II error happens when we fail to not reject null hypothesis when it is actually false. It is also called as 'false-negative'. The chance of type II error to occur is inversely proportional to the statistical power of the study.
