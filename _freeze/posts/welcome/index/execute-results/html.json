The main reason why I made this blog was to have a source of medium for me to write articles in science and share them with the world. This first version of this blog was made using the `{distill}` package in R and you can find the link to it [here](https://jeweljohnsonj.github.io/jeweljohnson.github.io/). From then I moved on and remade the blog using the latest `{quarto}` package in R. This new package proves to be an upgrade from `{distill}` and I am starting to love the new features of it. Since I am also fond of using R, I took it upon me to write a few tutorials focusing on beginners, which you can find in this blog.\n\nUpdate (26-May-2022): I have also written a few articles on basic statistics and how to do them in R.\n\n## How did I make this blog\n\nThere are several well-explained tutorials which explain from scratch how one can build a blog. If you are planning to use `{quarto}` for making your blog, then the quarto website itself features well written beginner friendly tutorials. Apart from that I found two other posts which also proved very useful while creating this blog. The links are given below.\n\n-   [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)\n-   [Porting from distill to quarto](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/)\n-   [We don't talk about Quarto](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/)\n\n#### Last updated on {.unnumbered .unlisted}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"2022-05-26 13:32:24 IST\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<a hidden href=\"https://info.flagcounter.com/ynrK\"><img src=\"https://s11.flagcounter.com/count2/ynrK/bg_000000/txt_FFFFFF/border_F0F0F0/columns_5/maxflags_25/viewers_0/labels_1/pageviews_1/flags_0/percent_0/\" alt=\"Flag Counter\" border=\"0\"/></a>\n",
