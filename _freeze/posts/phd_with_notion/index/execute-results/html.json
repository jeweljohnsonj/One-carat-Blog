In simple words, you can think of Notion as a medium to host you own personal Wiki!\n\n::: {.column-page}\n![](images/notion_interface.png)\n\nMy Notion dashboard.\n:::\n\nHere is an introduction video from Notion themselves.\n\n:::{.column-page}\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oTahLEX3NXo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n:::\n\n## My Notion story\n\nMy journey in discovering Notion came from my quest to find a software that is able to track the research articles that I read. Naturally I began to use a reference manager software, Zotero, which is free to use and is open source. Zotero even comes in with a build in pdf reader which you can use to highlight, comment and insert notes within a research article. This was very helpful as it enabled me to write my thoughts about the paper and summarize the results of the paper, which can be helpful if you are writing a research article yourself where you will be citing other papers. But soon I realized a big problem. The problem is that Zotero does not provide a clean user interface to show the notes I made on a paper. What I was looking for was a table interface where one of the columns had the 'title of the paper', the next column had 'the authors name' and another column titled 'summary', where I list down a short summary of the paper as bullet points and so on.\n\n::: {.column-page}\n\n| Title  | Authors  | Date added  | Year of publication | Summary  | URL  |\n|--------|----------|-------------|-------|----------|------|\n| Glyphosate impairs collective thermoregulation in bumblebees       | (Weidenm√ºller et al., 2022)         |     22-June-2022        |  2022     |   1.

Glyphosate affected bees invest less time in incubating the brood       | https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf7482     |\n\n: The table interface I was looking for\n:::\n\nNow Zotero is not expected to have features like this simply because it is a reference manager and not a note taking application. So I began looking for an application which have this exact feature. A simple Google search lead me to people suggesting Microsoft Excel and Google docs as their note taking medium for summarizing the research articles they read. It sure works but is extremely cumbersome. You have to manually fill in all the columns and that is unnecessary work. Also its not an elegant way of categorizing the data. I wanted something which was highly customizable and at the same time is automated to an extent. Like for Zotero how you can just add the pdf file of a research article and it automatically populates relevant details like Title, Authors, Year etc by grabbing information from the metadata of the paper or by looking it up in the internet. And to my surprise I came across a tweet in Twitter which had exactly what I was looking for. Thank you [@thoughtsofaphd](https://twitter.com/thoughtsofaphd) for that.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-theme=\"dark\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Literature Tracker 2.0: Create a FREE customizable database in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/airtable?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@airtable</a> for keeping track of all the papers you download (and maybe readüòÇ). <br><br>Please share if you find it helpful!<br><br>‚ö°Ô∏èHere&#39;s an easy step-by-step guide: <a href=\"https://t.co/jBQ0XeQahg\">https://t.co/jBQ0XeQahg</a><br><br>cc <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AcademicChatter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AcademicChatter</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/jLAkIlM2wQ\">pic.twitter.com/jLAkIlM2wQ</a></p>&mdash; thoughtsofaphd (@thoughtsofaphd) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thoughtsofaphd/status/1479523545030049800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 7, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> \n\nIn the [tweet](https://twitter.com/thoughtsofaphd/status/1479523545030049800?s=20&t=d0ECsFWcXB_v1o9rHyAa9g) I learned about a new software called as [Airtable](https://airtable.com) and by following the guide given in the tweet, I made myself a literature tracker for managing the summaries of the papers I read.\n\n::: {.column-page}\n![](images/airtable.png)\n\nMy literature tracker template in Airtable\n:::\n\nEverything was going smoothly and I was in love with the new user interface Airtable provided. But I was still annoyed by the fact that I still have to manually type in the basic information like \"name of the paper\", \"authors name\" etc. and quite frankly it was becoming quite tedious as the number of papers in my collection grew in number. If there was someway to connect Zotero to Airtable that would have made my life easy. So upon searching for a solution I came to know that there is an integration feature developed by [Avana Vana](https://github.com/avanavana). But upon reading about the [feature](https://github.com/avanavana/esovdb-api) in Github I quickly realized that it was beyond my current ability to comprehend what was happening and how to implement it. I did what any honest person would have done after that. I gave up on Airtable and went to look for an alternative. And that's how I came to meet Notion!\n\nAs I began learning about Notion I quickly realized the rich potential it offered. Initially I just wanted a tabular database where I could efficiently write down the summaries of the papers that I read. But upon seeing how others use Notion in their daily life, I couldn't help myself to try those features, expand on them and implement them in my day to day activities. So after putting in some hours in learning Notion, I was able to create a beautiful template which housed as a database storing all the details of the papers I read.\n\n::: {.column-page}\n![](images/notion_summary.png)\n\nMy literature tracker template in Notion\n:::\n\nThis template is a significantly improved version from that of the Airtable template. One of the best improvement was that this new template is now automated. We humans are not meant to write standard titles. With the help of the plugin [Notero](https://github.com/dvanoni/notero) by [David Vanoni](https://twitter.com/dvanoni), you can seamlessly integrate your Zotero literature collection with your work space in Notion. This plugin was a game changer for me. And thus began my Notion journey starting from this literature tracker template.\n\n## Do you need Notion?\n\nNotion is like the LEGO set that you had when you were a child. You can build almost anything with Notion and it is tailored to give you a personal Wiki experience. You are mostly only limited by your creativity and needs. The learning curve for Notion is not a hard one and its pretty much self intuitive. Whatever I was able to do until now required only a week of learning from my side. With that said you can also get a wide variety of templates, mostly for free which can satisfy most of your needs. Most features of Notion are free for personal use but they also have different subscription based plans for advanced power users. You can learn more about their plans [here](https://www.notion.so/pricing). Also keep in mind that you need an active internet connection to use Notion.\n\nNow let us answer the elephant in the room. Is it secure? The answer is yes and no. Notion uses encryption to encrypt data when its been sent and received between the user and Notion. But created databases that are stored in Notion's cloud service is not encrypted. Which means employees of Notion are able to access your data. Notion [states](https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/dthqsd/are_our_documents_in_notion_encryption_on_the/f6xz2em/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that the reason they dont use end to end encryption is becuase it would make certain features like full text search impossible to implement. Notion is also part of [Security First Initiative](https://www.businesswire.com/news/hk-zh/20220308005244/en/Top-Tech-Firms-Launch-Security-First-Initiative) which pledges to put security first by sharing their security information proactively with their customers. So in my opinion I think its safe to use Notion unless you create tables containing your credit card info or account passwords. If you are a researcher, I would also recommend that you do not attach any sensitive research data to Notion for safety. With over 30 million users and growing and, with strong ideals on user security and data protection, Notion is as good any other productive software like Slack, Evernote etc. in terms of data security.\n\nI have a made a couple of templates using Notion and if you find them interesting you can give it a try and see if Notion works for you.\n\n## Installing Notion\n\n1. Go to [Notion website](https://www.notion.so/) and sign up for a free account. You can use your gmail account for a quick sign in.\n2. Notion can be used from your browser itself. But if you want work from your desktop, please install the [desktop app](https://www.notion.so/desktop).\n3. Once installed, go to this link and duplicate the 'PhD Dashboard' which contains all the templates that I made. All the templates are completely free to use.\n\nI have written separate tutorials introducing each of the templates.\n\n\n#### Last updated on {.unnumbered .unlisted}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"2022-06-29 09:48:59 IST\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<a hidden href=\"https://info.flagcounter.com/ynrK\"><img src=\"https://s11.flagcounter.com/count2/ynrK/bg_000000/txt_FFFFFF/border_F0F0F0/columns_5/maxflags_25/viewers_0/labels_1/pageviews_1/flags_0/percent_0/\" alt=\"Flag Counter\" border=\"0\"/></a>\n",
