I heard from my friends who are doing PhD that they spent a hefty amount of time binge-watching movies and series and most of them also read a lot of new books. So I thought why not make a template that will help them manage this. The templates are very simple and visually pleasing.\n\nThis might be my shortest article ever on this blog but I thought this post can act as a source to receive feedback and comments about the templates. The links for the templates are given below.\n\n1.  [Movie list tracker](https://jeweljohnson.notion.site/c13997d07e0444bd9d3caf6d068a99b2?v=602485e9f6fe4357a1db88043cfd0450)\n2.  [Book list tracker](https://jeweljohnson.notion.site/9805efc31e5a4b39b1e29870f1febd1c?v=0cbadae558e140d7a7d339cb677f052f)\n\n## Movie list tracker\n\n::: column-page\n![Movie list tracker](images/movie.png)\n:::\n\nYou can categorise the list to their 'watch status' and also indicate if it's a movie or a series. Furthermore, if watch a lot of series, then you can also add in the extra columns indicating the season and so on. In the poster column, I have embedded an online image link showcasing the movie or series poster. This is done so that the media collection view (gallery view) can use these images and show visually pleasing cards. You can get the poster image links for most of the movies and series from [here](https://www.movieposterdb.com/). The progress section shows the data in a 'kanban' view to quickly visualize the watch list according to their status.\n\n## Book list tracker\n\n::: column-page\n![Movie list tracker](images/book.png)\n:::\n\nThe book list tracker is almost identical to the movie list one. To get the book cover image links for the database, you can visit [here](https://www.goodreads.com/). The way you add entries is also pretty self intuitive so I urge you to explore it yourself.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI hope you find these templates useful. You can give your feedback and thoughts about the template in the comment section below this article.\n\n#### Last updated on {.unnumbered .unlisted .appendix}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"2023-04-03 20:47:10 IST\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<a hidden href=\"https://info.flagcounter.com/ynrK\"><img src=\"https://s11.flagcounter.com/count2/ynrK/bg_000000/txt_FFFFFF/border_F0F0F0/columns_5/maxflags_25/viewers_0/labels_1/pageviews_1/flags_0/percent_0/\" alt=\"Flag Counter\" border=\"0\"/></a>\n",
