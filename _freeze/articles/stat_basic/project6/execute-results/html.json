The likelihood is set by the user and generally, they are set at 95%.\n\n::: callout-important\n## Definition of 95% CI\n\n**A 95% confidence interval means that if the experiment were to be repeated multiple times, 95% of the calculated intervals from the experiments would contain the true point estimate value**\n:::\n\nThe CI is descriptive statistics which is used for population data but can also be used for sample data.\n\nThe formula for finding CI is;\n\n\n$$CI = \\mu ± z*S.E = \\mu ± z*(\\sigma/\\sqrt n)$$ Where $\\mu$ is sample mean, $S.E$ is standard error of means, $z$ is z-value, $\\sigma$ is standard deviation and $n$ is the sample size.\n\nFor calculating 95% CI the corresponding z-value is 1.96. Normally for sufficiently large value sample sizes this formula works fine, but for sample sizes \\< 30, instead of the z-score we use the t-statistic which is obtained from the t-distribution. Also in this case, instead of $n$ in the denominator, we use degrees of freedom which $n-1$. The formula then becomes;\n\n$$CI = \\mu ± t*(\\sigma/\\sqrt{n-1})$$ The t-statistic will depend on the degrees of freedom and the confidence level.\n\n\nThe confidence interval can be more useful when compared to p-value as they convey the precision of our estimates. The width of the CI is affected by the sample size and standard deviation, therefore CI with higher sample sizes is better in representing the population estimate. Generally, the standard deviation used for calculating CI should be the population standard deviation which unfortunately is most times an unknown value. Therefore for the calculations, it is better to use the SD from the control group as they resemble SD value close to the population value as they don't undergo treatment. If both the control group and the treatment group have equal or close to equal variances, then we can use \"pooled SD\" for calculating the CI. Pooled SD is the average of both the treatment and the control groups SD.\n\n## Effect size\n\nAs previously mentioned, the p-value does not convey any information about the magnitude of an effect. The CI does a fair job of giving us a range of values but it is dependent on the sample size. This is where effect size comes in. The effect size of a study tells us the magnitude of the difference between the two groups. There are many ways effect size can be calculated as shown in the table below.\n\n[![Fig1: Effect sizes.
