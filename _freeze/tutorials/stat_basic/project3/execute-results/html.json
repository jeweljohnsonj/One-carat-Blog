It calculates the error in a sample statistic compared to the corresponding population parameter.\n\nThe formula to calculate the standard error of mean is;\n\n\n$$\\sigma_{\\bar{X}} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{N}}$$\n\n\nwhere $\\sigma_{\\bar{X}}$ is standard error of mean, $s$ is sample standard deviation and $N$ is sample size.\n\nAs you can see from the formula, if we increase our sampling size, the standard error of the mean decreases, and therefore our sample mean will closely resemble the population mean.\n\n## Standard deviation\n\nThe equivalent of standard error, but for a sample in a population. Simply put, it tells us how much spread is there within a data, more precisely speaking, how much each of our data points are spread around the mean.\n\nThe formula to calculate the standard deviation of the mean is;\n\n\n$$s = \\sqrt{s^{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (x_{i} - \\bar{x})^{2}}{N - 1}}$$ where $s$ is standard deviation, $\\sqrt{s^{2}}$ is variance, $x_{i}$ is your data point, $\\bar{x}$ is sample mean and $N$ is sample size.\n\nStandard deviation is generally constant across the population and is larger than the standard error of the mean. Because of this sometimes researchers cheat out by using standard error of the mean in the results, rather than using standard deviation, which leads to a false idea that their measurements are accurate.\n\n## Standard normal distribution\n\nA normal distribution with mean($\\mu$) = 1 and variance($\\sigma^{2}$) = 1 is called as a `standard normal distribution` or a `z-distribution`. With the help of standard deviation, we can split the area under the curve of standard normal distribution into three parts. This partitioning of the area is known as the `68–95–99.7 rule`. What it means is that;\n\n-   68% of the data will lie within $±\\sigma$ from $\\mu$\n-   95% of the data will lie within $±2\\sigma$ from $\\mu$\n-   99.7% of the data will lie within $±3\\sigma$ from $\\mu$\n\n[![Fig1: 68--95--99.7 rule.
