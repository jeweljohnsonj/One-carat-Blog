This tutorial serves as a continuation from the tutorial post: [Introduction to statistical modelling in R](https://one-carat-blog.netlify.app/tutorials/stat_model/intro_stat_model.html). Here you will learn more on effect size and interaction, the concepts of total and partial change, sampling variability and mathematical transforms, and the implications of something called collinearity.
