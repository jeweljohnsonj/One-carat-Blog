## Distribution and variance

Let us look at the `penguins` dataset from the `{palmerpenguins}` package in R. We will plot the distribution curve for "body mass" of the "Chinstrap" species of penguins.

```{r}
#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins %>% filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>% ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g)) + 
  xlab("Body Mass (g)") + ylab("Density") + ggtitle("Body mass distribution") + 
  geom_density(fill = "darkred") + 
  labs(subtitle = paste0("N=",penguins %>% filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>% nrow())) +
  theme_bw()
```

As you can see, the data distribution closely resembles a "bell-shaped" curve. This kind of distribution is known as a `normal distribution` or a `Gaussian distribution`. On closer look, you can also see that the area under the curve is almost symmetrical to both sides and there is only a single peak present. We can also learn about the `variance` of the data by looking at the width of the curve. A wider curve means variance is higher and a narrower curve means variance in the data is smaller. Also for a normal distribution, there are no visible outliers present in the plot. Outliers are those data points which fall out of the normal trend in the data. The peak represents the `mean` of the data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

# Create function to get mode
getmode <- function(v) {
   uniqv <- unique(v)
   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}

pen_avg <- penguins %>% filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>% summarise(mean = mean(body_mass_g),
                                                          median = median(body_mass_g),
                                                          mode = getmode(body_mass_g))

penguins %>% filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g)) + 
  xlab("Body Mass (g)") + ylab("Density") + ggtitle("Body mass distribution") + 
  geom_density(fill = "grey") + 
  labs(subtitle = paste0("N=",penguins %>% filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>% nrow())) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = pen_avg$mean, colour = "red")) +
  geom_text(aes(x=pen_avg$mean, label="mean", y=4e-04), colour="red", angle=90, vjust = 1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = pen_avg$median, colour = "blue")) +
  geom_text(aes(x=pen_avg$median, label="median", y=4e-04), colour="blue", angle=90, vjust = -1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +
geom_vline(aes(xintercept = pen_avg$mode, colour = "green")) +
  geom_text(aes(x=pen_avg$mode, label="mode", y=4e-04), colour="green", angle=90, vjust = -1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +
  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position="none")
```

For a normal distribution the `mean`, `median` and `mode` are all the same value and are in the middle of the curve. From the plot above you can see that all the averages are almost the same. In general all three modes of averages tries to represent the centre of the dataset for any distribution. With that said some mode of average is preferred over others in terms of the nature of the distribution, we will see what it means later on.

Now let us look the same distribution but for "Gentoo" species of penguins.

```{r}
#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins %>% filter(species == "Gentoo") %>% ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g)) + 
  xlab("Body Mass (g)") + ylab("Density") + ggtitle("Body mass distribution") + 
  geom_density(fill = "darkblue") + 
  labs(subtitle = paste0("N=",penguins %>% filter(species == "Gentoo") %>% nrow())) +
  theme_bw()
```

Unlike the previous curve this one has two peaks. This kind of curve is an example for a "bimodal distribution". Now what would have caused these two peaks to form in this one but not in the first one? So we can guess that there is some hidden variable that is affecting the body mass distribution of Gentoo penguins. What about the 'sex' of the penguins? Will that have any effect? Let us try plotting the same plot but in terms of the sex of the penguins.

```{r}
#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins %>% filter(species == "Gentoo") %>% drop_na() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = sex)) + 
  xlab("Body Mass (g)") + ylab("Density") + ggtitle("Body mass distribution") + 
  geom_density() + 
  labs(subtitle = paste0("N=",penguins %>% filter(species == "Gentoo") %>% nrow())) +
  theme_bw()
```

Ha! We were spot on! So it looks like male Gentoos are generally larger in comparison to females.

Now let us consider the plot given below.

```{r}
#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

diamonds %>% filter(cut == "Fair") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat)) + 
  xlab("carats") + ylab("Density") + ggtitle("Diamond carat distribution") + 
  geom_density(fill = "gold") + 
  labs(subtitle = paste0("N=",diamonds %>% filter(cut == "Fair") %>% nrow())) +
  theme_bw()
```

This is an example of a "skewed distribution". Moreover, this is a "right-skewed distribution", why is it called right-skewed? Look at the same plot below.

```{r}
#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

# Create function to get mode
getmode <- function(v) {
   uniqv <- unique(v)
   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}

diamonds %>% filter(cut == "Fair") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat)) + 
  xlab("carats") + ylab("Density") + ggtitle("Diamond carat distribution") + 
  geom_density(fill = "gold") + 
  labs(subtitle = paste0("N=",diamonds %>% filter(cut == "Fair") %>% nrow())) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(diamonds$carat), colour = "red")) +
  geom_text(aes(x=mean(diamonds$carat), label="mean", y=1), colour="red", angle=90, vjust = 1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(diamonds$carat), colour = "blue")) +
  geom_text(aes(x=median(diamonds$carat), label="median", y=1), colour="blue", angle=90, vjust = -1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +
geom_vline(aes(xintercept = getmode(diamonds$carat), colour = "green")) +
  geom_text(aes(x=getmode(diamonds$carat), label="mode", y=1), colour="green", angle=90, vjust = -1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +
  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position="none")
```

I have plotted the mean, median, and mode values for the plot and you can see that the mean value is more than the mode value. This is why the curve is indicated as right-skewed, as the mean is skewed towards the right side of the mode value. If it was the other way around then the curve will be called "left-skewed". Also in this case, if we had used the mean value to represent the dataset it would have been a poor choice and you see that the median is a better choice compared to the mean. Therefore when the dataset is skewed, the median is the better choice to represent the dataset. The mode will be best suited for datasets with a lot of repeated values.

## Variance

The variance of data is defined as the average squared difference from the mean of the data. It tells us how far each of our data points is from the mean value.



The formula for finding the variance is as follows;

$$s^{2} = \frac{\sum (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2}}{n - 1}$$

Where $s^{2}$ is `sample variance`, $x_{i}$ is your data point, $\bar{x}$ is mean and $n$ is the sample size.

For a sufficiently large value of $n$, the equation for variance will become;

$$\sigma^{2} = \frac{\sum (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2}}{n}$$ where $\sigma^{2}$ is called `population variance`.

Here $\sigma$ is called the `standard deviation` of the data which we will see in the next chapter.

When we compare both equations, you can see that the sample variance has $n-1$ in the denominator when compared to just $n$ in population variance. The $n-1$ used in the formula is called the `Bessel's correction` which aims to improve the accuracy in determining the sample variance as close as the population variance.
