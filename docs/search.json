By statistically analysing six key parameters, each country is given a score (which is called happiness score within the dataset). The higher the score, the happier the country is and vice versa. The six key parameters which are taken into analysis for determining the score are;\n\nGross domestic product per capita\nSocial support\nHealthy life expectancy\nFreedom to make your own life choices\nGenerosity of the general population\nPerceptions of internal and external corruption levels.\n\nFinland is ranked first among 149 countries with an overall score of 7.82. Despite COVID 19 wrecking havoc around the world, citizens of Finland have persevered through it and they have been maintaining first rank since 2016. Afghanistan is at the lowest rank with a score of 2.40. With complications from COVID 19 pandemic and the Taliban take over, Afghanistan is going through one of the worst humanitarian crisis in human history and the ranking reflects it."

This new package proves to be an upgrade from distill and I am starting to love the new features of it.

This includes the different labels of the graph, fonts used, colour of axes, the background of the graph etc. By changing the theme we would not be changing or transforming how the data will look in the graph. Instead, we would only change the visual appearances in the graph and by doing so we can make it more aesthetically pleasing.

    "text": "3 Changing colour palettes in ggplot2\nApart from ready to use themes, there are also ready to use colour palettes which we can use. A colour palette contains a set of pre-defined colours which will be applied to the different geometries present in a graph.\nChoosing a good colour palette is important as it helps us to represent data in a better way and at the same time, it also makes the graph easier to read for people with colour blindness. Let us see a few popular colour palette packages used in R.\n\n3.1 viridis package\nviridis package is a popularly used colour palette in R. It is aesthetically pleasing and well designed to improve readability for colour blind people. The {virids} package was developed by Bob Rudis, Noam Ross and Simon Garnier. There are eight different colour scales present in this package. The name of the tab denotes the colour scale present in this package.\n\nCodelibrary(viridis)\n\n\n\n\nviridis\nmagma\nplasma\ninferno\ncividis\nmako\nrocket\nturbo\n\n\n\n\nShow the codelibrary(Stat2Data)\nlibrary(viridis)\ndata(\"BirdNest\")\n\nggplot(BirdNest, aes(Nesttype, Length, fill = Nesttype)) + geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(x= \"Type of nest\", y= \"Mean body length for the species (in cm)\",\n       fill= \"Nest type\", title= \"Relationship between body length and nest types\",\n       subtitle = \"Data shown for 84 different species of North American passerines\",\n       caption= \"DataSource: BridNest dataset in Stat2Data r-package\") +\n  theme_bw() + scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = \"viridis\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the codelibrary(Stat2Data)\nlibrary(viridis)\ndata(\"BirdNest\")\n\nggplot(BirdNest, aes(Nesttype, Length, fill = Nesttype)) + geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(x= \"Type of nest\", y= \"Mean body length for the species (in cm)\",\n       fill= \"Nest type\", title= \"Relationship between body length and nest types\",\n       subtitle = \"Data shown for 84 different species of North American passerines\",\n       caption= \"DataSource: BridNest dataset in Stat2Data r-package\") +\n  theme_bw() + scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = \"magma\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the codelibrary(Stat2Data)\nlibrary(viridis)\ndata(\"BirdNest\")\n\nggplot(BirdNest, aes(Nesttype, Length, fill = Nesttype)) + geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(x= \"Type of nest\", y= \"Mean body length for the species (in cm)\",\n       fill= \"Nest type\", title= \"Relationship between body length and nest types\",\n       subtitle = \"Data shown for 84 different species of North American passerines\",\n       caption= \"DataSource: BridNest dataset in Stat2Data r-package\") +\n  theme_bw() + scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = \"plasma\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the codelibrary(Stat2Data)\nlibrary(viridis)\ndata(\"BirdNest\")\n\nggplot(BirdNest, aes(Nesttype, Length, fill = Nesttype)) + geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(x= \"Type of nest\", y= \"Mean body length for the species (in cm)\",\n       fill= \"Nest type\", title= \"Relationship between body length and nest types\",\n       subtitle = \"Data shown for 84 different species of North American passerines\",\n       caption= \"DataSource: BridNest dataset in Stat2Data r-package\") +\n  theme_bw() + scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = \"inferno\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the codelibrary(Stat2Data)\nlibrary(viridis)\ndata(\"BirdNest\")\n\nggplot(BirdNest, aes(Nesttype, Length, fill = Nesttype)) + geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(x= \"Type of nest\", y= \"Mean body length for the species (in cm)\",\n       fill= \"Nest type\", title= \"Relationship between body length and nest types\",\n       subtitle = \"Data shown for 84 different species of North American passerines\",\n       caption= \"DataSource: BridNest dataset in Stat2Data r-package\") +\n  theme_bw() + scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = \"cividis\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the codelibrary(Stat2Data)\nlibrary(viridis)\ndata(\"BirdNest\")\n\nggplot(BirdNest, aes(Nesttype, Length, fill = Nesttype)) + geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(x= \"Type of nest\", y= \"Mean body length for the species (in cm)\",\n       fill= \"Nest type\", title= \"Relationship between body length and nest types\",\n       subtitle = \"Data shown for 84 different species of North American passerines\",\n       caption= \"DataSource: BridNest dataset in Stat2Data r-package\") +\n  theme_bw() + scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = \"mako\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the codelibrary(Stat2Data)\nlibrary(viridis)\ndata(\"BirdNest\")\n\nggplot(BirdNest, aes(Nesttype, Length, fill = Nesttype)) + geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(x= \"Type of nest\", y= \"Mean body length for the species (in cm)\",\n       fill= \"Nest type\", title= \"Relationship between body length and nest types\",\n       subtitle = \"Data shown for 84 different species of North American passerines\",\n       caption= \"DataSource: BridNest dataset in Stat2Data r-package\") +\n  theme_bw() + scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = \"rocket\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the codelibrary(Stat2Data)\nlibrary(viridis)\ndata(\"BirdNest\")\n\nggplot(BirdNest, aes(Nesttype, Length, fill = Nesttype)) + geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(x= \"Type of nest\", y= \"Mean body length for the species (in cm)\",\n       fill= \"Nest type\", title= \"Relationship between body length and nest types\",\n       subtitle = \"Data shown for 84 different species of North American passerines\",\n       caption= \"DataSource: BridNest dataset in Stat2Data r-package\") +\n  theme_bw() + scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = \"turbo\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 wesanderson package\nIf you like your colours distinctive and narrative, just like how American film-maker Mr. Wes Anderson would like it, then try the wesanderson package.

You are expected to know how the basic syntaxes of R language work like how to assign values, how to load your data, the different operations of R, and so on. If you just started out on your R journey then this chapter and the rest will become a roadblock for you. But fear not, there are some amazing websites that teach you the very basics of R, and that too for free! For an interactive way of learning, I recommend DataCamp. It is an online platform for learning programming languages. They have both paid and free classes. Luckily for us, they are providing the introductory classes on R programming for free. This would be a great way to start your R journey. After you completed the course on data camp you can come back to this blog and you will find it very easy to comprehend and learn the various chapters that are available here. Coming from my own experience, it would be really helpful if you have your own data to work with. Rather than religiously following the steps in these chapters, I would recommend you have a goal in your mind before diving into the chapters. The goal should be to try incorporating the things you learned here into your own data. That would be the best way to learn anything in R. Hope you have a great time learning!"

    "text": "2 Introduction to ggplot2 package\nIn this chapter we will be plotting different types of graphs using a package called ggplot2 in R. The ggplot2 package is based on ‘grammar of graphics plot’ which provides a systematic way of doing data visualizations in R. With a few lines of code you can plot a simple graph and by adding more layers onto it you can create complex yet elegant data visualizations.\nA ggplot2 graph is made up of three components.\n\n\nData: Data of your choice that you want to visually summarise.\n\nGeometry or geoms: Geometry dictates the type of graph that you want to plot and this information is conveyed to ggplot2 through the geom() command code. For e.g. using the geom_boxplot() command, you can plot a box plot with your data. Likewise, there are many types of geometry that you can plot using the ggplot2 package.\n\nAesthetic mappings: Aesthetics define the different kinds of information that you want to include in the plot. One fo the most important aesthetic is in choosing which data values to plot on the x-axis and the y-axis. Another example is changing the colour of the data points, which can be used to differentiate two different categories in the data. The use of aesthetics depends on the geometry that you are using. We use the command aes() for adding different types of aesthetics to the plot. We will learn more about aes() in Chapter 2.\n\nThis tutorial is primarily focused on students who are beginners in R programming and wants to quickly plot their data without much of a hassle. So without further ado let’s plot some graphs!"

    "section": "\n3 Setting up the prerequisites",
    "text": "3 Setting up the prerequisites\nFirst, we need to install the ggplot2 package in R as it does not come in the standard distribution of R.\n\nTo install packages in R we use the command install.packages() and to load packages we use the command library(). Therefore to install and load ggplot2 package we use the following lines of command.\n\n\nCodeinstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\nAll right we have the ggplot2 package loaded, now we just need some data to plot. Most R programming tutorials use the iris dataset as an example. But this tutorial won’t be like most tutorials. So let me introduce you to some lovely penguins from Palmer Station in Antarctica!\nFor this tutorial, we will be installing the palmerpenguins package which showcases body measurements taken from three different species of penguins from Antarctica. This package was made possible by the efforts of Dr. Allison Horst. The penguin data was collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER.\n\nInstall the palmerpenguins package and load it in R.\n\n\nCodeinstall.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\n\nNow there are two datasets in this package. We will be using the penguins dataset which is a simplified version of the raw data present in the package.\n\nUse the command head() to display the first few values of penguins dataset to see how it looks like\n\n\nCodelibrary(palmerpenguins)\nknitr::kable(head(penguins))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\nisland\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nflipper_length_mm\nbody_mass_g\nsex\nyear\n\n\n\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n39.1\n18.7\n181\n3750\nmale\n2007\n\n\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n39.5\n17.4\n186\n3800\nfemale\n2007\n\n\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n40.3\n18.0\n195\n3250\nfemale\n2007\n\n\nAdelie\nTorgersen\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n2007\n\n\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n36.7\n19.3\n193\n3450\nfemale\n2007\n\n\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n39.3\n20.6\n190\n3650\nmale\n2007\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that are 8 columns in the dataset representing different values. Now let us try plotting some graphs with this data.\n\n3.1 Bar graph\nSo we will try to plot a simple bar graph first. Bar graphs are used to represent categorical data where the height of the rectangular bar represents the value for that category. We will plot a bargraph representing frequency data for all three species of penguins.\n\nWe will be using the geom_bar() command to plot the bar graph. Let us also use the command theme_bw() for a nice looking theme.\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, fill = species)) + \n  xlab(\"Species\") + ylab(\"Frequency\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Frequency of individuals for each species\") + \n  geom_bar() + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Histogram\nHistograms are similar to bar graphs visually. But histograms are used to represent continuous data. Also the all the rectangular bars will have the same bin size or width.\n\nWe can plot a histogram using the command geom_histogram().\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) + \n  xlab(\"Body Mass (g)\") + ylab(\"Frequency\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Frequency of individuals for respective body mass\") + \n  geom_histogram(bins = 25) + theme_bw()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe warning message indicates that for two rows in the dataset, they have NA values or that they did not have any values present. This is true for real-life cases, as during data collection sometimes you will be unable to collect data due to various reasons. So this is perfectly fine.\n\n3.3 Line graph\nLine graph simply joins together data points to show overall distribution.\n\nUse the command geom_line() for plotting a line graph.\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, \n                            y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species)) + \n  xlab(\"Bill length (mm)\") + ylab(\"Bill depth (mm)\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Bill length vs Bill depth\") + geom_line() + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Scatter plot\nThe scatter plot simply denotes the data points in the dataset.\n\nUse the command geom_point() to plot a scatter plot.\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, \n                            shape = species, colour = species)) + \n  xlab(\"Body mass (g)\") + ylab(\"Flipper length (mm)\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Body mass vs Filpper length\") + geom_point(size = 2) + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Density Plot\nDensity plots are similar to histograms but show it shows the overall distribution of the data in a finer way. This way we will get a bell-shaped curve if our data follows a normal distribution.\n\nUse the command geom_density() to a density plot.\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) + \n  xlab(\"Body Mass (g)\") + ylab(\"Density\") + ggtitle(\"Body mass distribution\") + \n  geom_density() + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nSince we plotted for all three species the graph looks clustered. Let us try plotting the same graph for only gentoo penguins. We will use the dplyr package to filter() data for gentoo penguins alone. The dplyr package comes in-built with R so just load the dplyr package using the command library().\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\npenguins_gentoo <- penguins %>% filter(species == \"Gentoo\")\n\nggplot(data = penguins_gentoo, aes(x = body_mass_g)) + \n  xlab(\"Body Mass of Gentoo penguins (g)\") + ylab(\"Density\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Body mass distribution of Gentoo penguins\") + \n  geom_density(fill = \"red\") + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6 Dot-plot\nDot-plot is similar to a density plot but it shows discretely each data point in the distribution.\n\nUse the command geom_dotplot() to plot a dot-plot.\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, fill = species)) + \n  xlab(\"Species\") + ylab(\"Body mass (g)\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Body mass in three diferent species of penguins\") + \n  geom_dotplot(binaxis = \"y\", stackdir = \"center\", binwidth = 100) + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7 Rug-plot\nRug-plot is a simple way to visualize the distribution of data along the axis lines. It is often used in conjunction with other graphical representations.\n\nUse the command geom_rug() to plot a rug-plot.\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\npenguins_gentoo <- penguins %>% filter(species == \"Gentoo\")\n\nggplot(data = penguins_gentoo, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) + \n  xlab(\"Body Mass of Gentoo penguins (g)\") + ylab(\"Density\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Body mass distribution of Gentoo penguins\") + \n  geom_point(colour = \"darkred\") + geom_rug() + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8 Box plot\nBox-plot is one of the better ways of showing data via quartiles. You can learn more about box plots here.\n\nUse the command geom_boxplot() to plot a box-plot.\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, colour = species)) + \n  xlab(\"Species\") + ylab(\"Body mass (g)\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Body mass in three diferent species of penguins\") + geom_boxplot() + \n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n3.9 Violin plot\nViolin plot can be considered as the best of both a box-plot and a density plot. It shows the quartile values, like in a box-plot and also shows the distribution of the data, like in a density plot.\n\nUse the command geom_violin() in conjunction with geom_boxplot() to plot a violin plot.\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, fill = species)) + \n  xlab(\"Species\") + ylab(\"Body mass (g)\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Body mass in three diferent species of penguins\") + \n  geom_violin(aes(colour = species), trim = TRUE) + geom_boxplot(width = 0.2) +\n  theme_bw()"

Using this package you can make publication grade plots without spending too much time modifying things. Even if you are a beginner in R programming and does not know how to use theggplot2 package, you will still be able to plot graphs using the ggpubr package because of how easy the syntax is. But having prior knowledge of the ggplot2 package will surely make things easier, and an experienced person will know that any plot which can be plotted using ggpubr can also be plotted using ggplot2. So let us start!\nFirst things first, install the ggpubr package and load it in the library.\n\nCodeinstall.packages(\"ggpubr\")\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n\n\nLet us see what all plots can be plotted."

The size and colour of the dot can be attributed to different values in the dataset.\n\nCodelibrary(viridis)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n\nggballoonplot(mtcars, fill = \"value\") + \n  scale_fill_viridis(option = \"turbo\")\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Bar plot\nA simple bar graph which is used for representing categorical data. By using the add function inside the main plot function, you can easily display summary statistics like mean, median etc. and various types of errors like standard error, standard deviation and various others. You can view the whole list of features here.\n\nCode# install.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggbarplot(penguins,\n          x = \"species\",\n          y = \"bill_length_mm\",\n          add = c(\"mean_sd\"),\n          fill = \"species\",\n          label = TRUE,\n          lab.nb.digits = 2,\n          lab.vjust = -2.2,\n          lab.col = \"red\",\n          title = \"Mean bill length of penguins\",\n          subtitle = \"Error bars shows standard deviation\",\n          xlab = \"Species of penguins\",\n          ylab = \"Bill length (mm)\",\n          ylim = c(0,60),\n          palette = \"npg\")\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Box plot\nStandard box plot graph.

Widely used to represent treatment groups showing before and after results of the same sample. We will be using the Anorexia dataset from the {PairedData} package in R. It features weights of girls before and after treatment for Anorexia.\n\nCode# install.packages(\"PairedData\")\nlibrary(PairedData)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\ndata(\"Anorexia\")\n\nAnorexia %>% \n  ggpaired(cond1 = \"Prior\",\n           cond2 = \"Post\",\n           title = \"Weights of girls before and after treatment for anorexia\",\n           xlab = \"Condition\",\n           ylab = \"Weight (lbs)\",\n           fill = \"condition\",\n           line.color = \"darkgreen\",\n           line.size = 0.2,\n           palette = \"simpsons\")\n\n\n\n\n\n2.13 Quantile-Quantile plot\nQuantile-Quantile plot or QQ plot is useful in assessing the distribution of a data.

For the dataset, we will first download the Stat2Data package which houses a lot of cool datasets. For this tutorial let us use the Hawks dataset which showcases body measurements from three different species of Hawks. This data was collected by students and faculty at Cornell College in Mount Vernon and the dataset was made available by late Prof. Bob Black at Cornell College.\n\nTo install packages in R we use the command install.packages() and to load packages we use the command library(). Therefore to install and load ggplot2 and {Stats2Data} packages we use the following lines of command.

    "text": "2 Building a plot\nOne thing to remember here is that how ggplot2 builds a graph is by adding layers. Let us start by plotting the basic layer first where the x-axis shows ‘weight of the hawks’ and the y-axis shows ‘wingspan of the hawks’.\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing))\n\n\n\n\nWait a sec! Where are my data points? So right now if we look at the syntax of the ggplot code we can see that we have not told ggplot2 which geometry we want. Do we want a scatter plot or a histogram or any other type of graph? So let us plot a scatter plot first. Use geom_point() command. By adding geom_point() to the ggplot() command is equivalent to adding an extra layer to the already existing layer that we got previously. Let us also use theme_bw() for a nice looking theme.\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing)) + geom_point() + \n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nWe got the graph! but we also got a warning message. The warning message tells us that the dataset which we had used to plot the graph had 11 rows of NA values and which could not be plotted into the graph. In real-life cases, we can have datasets with NA values due to various reasons, so this is fine.\nNow, this graph even though shows us data points we are not sure which point belongs to which species, as this dataset contains data for three species of Hawks. So let us try giving different colours to the points concerning the different species so that we are able to differentiate them.\n\n2.1 Changing colour\n\nTo change colour of the ‘element’ with respect to species, we have to add colour = Species within the aes() of the ggplot command. I use the general term ‘element’ here to emphasize that the same change in aesthetics will work for most of other types of geometries in ggplot2 (something which you have seen extensively in Chapter 1. Like for a line graph, the ‘element’ would be lines, here our ‘element’ is point.\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, colour = Species)) +\n  geom_point() + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nThe species abbreviations are the following: CH=Cooper’s, RT=Red-tailed, SS=Sharp-Shinned.\nNow, this graph is way better than the previous one.\n\n2.2 Changing point shape.\n\nNow instead of the colour let us change the shape of the point. Use shape() command in aes()\n\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, shape = Species)) + # instead of colour use shape.\n  geom_point() + theme_bw() \n\n\n\n\nNow we did change the shape of points but it is still hard to make out the difference. Let us try specifying colour along with the shape\n\nAdding both colour and shape in aesthetics\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, \n  colour = Species, shape = Species)) + geom_point() + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nThis plot is much better than the previous one.\nNow let us try specifying colour within the aes() of the geom()\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing)) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour = Species)) + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nWe got the same graph as before! So what is the difference in specifying colour within aes() of ggplot() compared to the same but within geom(). Let us look at another example.\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, colour = \"red\")) + \n  geom_point() + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nI manually changed the colour of the points to red colour. Now let try specifying colour to the aes() within the geom()\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, colour = \"red\")) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour = Species)) + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that the red colour is overridden by other colours. So the aes() mapping (in this case colour) within geom() will override any aes() mapping within ggplot(). And whatever aes() mapping we give within ggplot() will be inherited by all geom() layers that will be added along with the ggplot() layer.\nLet us see another case.\n\nShow the codelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing)) + \n  geom_point(colour = \"darkred\") + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the codelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing)) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour = \"darkred\")) + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nIf you compare both the codes, the only difference is that the colour = \"darkred\" command was outside aes() in the first code and inside aes() in the second code. So why didn’t the second graph have the same dark-red coloured points as the first one? The reason is that in the first code we are explicitly told to have all data points to be coloured dark-red but that is not the case with the second code. In the second code, since we have specified it inside aes(), ggplot is trying to look for a variable called “darkred” inside the dataset and colour it accordingly. This is why the legend that appears in the second graph has listed “darkred” as a category. And ggplot fails to find the variable called “darkred” but it still recognizes the colour command line and colour all the points in red. So the bottom line is that R has a pre-determined way of reading a code, so we users should well-understand what each line is expected to do and should not expect R to just fill it in accordingly to what we write.\nNow let us try a few other examples;\n\n2.3 Changing size\n\nUse size() in aes()\n\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Species, y = Hallux, size = Culmen)) + \n  geom_point() + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Changing colour, shape and size manually\n\nUse scale_shape_manual() for changing shape, similarly scale_color_manual() for changing colour and scale_size_manual() for changing size of the element.\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Hallux, colour = Species,\n                         shape = Species, size = Species)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  scale_shape_manual(values=c(1, 2, 3)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c('red','blue', 'green')) +\n  scale_size_manual(values=c(1,5,10)) + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Changing the opcaity of the elements\n\nUse alpha() within the geom() with a numeric value to change the opacity of the elements. This is useful for visualizing large datasets such as this.\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, colour = Species)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 1/5) + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nThe same commands also work for most of the other types of geom(). Now let us see a few other aesthetics in other types of geoms.\n\n2.6 Changing fill colour\n\nUse fill() in aes()\n\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, fill = Species)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 25) + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nUse scale_fill_manual() to manually change the colours.\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, fill = Species)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 25) + theme_bw() + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"darkred\", \"darkblue\", \"darkgreen\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7 Changing line type\n\nUse linetype in aes()\n\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, linetype = Species)) + \n  geom_line() + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can manually change line types using scale_linetype_manual()\n\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, linetype = Species)) + \n  geom_line() + \n  scale_linetype_manual(values= c(\"twodash\", \"longdash\", \"dotdash\")) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let us also see how to change the labels in a graph.\n\n2.8 Changing labels in the axes\n\nUse xlab() to change x-axis title, ylab() to change y-axis title, ggtitle() with label and subtitle to add title and subtitle respectively.\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, colour = Species)) +\n  geom_point() + theme_bw() + xlab(\"Weight (gm)\") + ylab(\"Wing (mm)\") +\n  ggtitle(label = \"Weight vs Wing span in three different species of Hawks\", \n          subtitle = \"CH=Cooper's, RT=Red-tailed, SS=Sharp-Shinned\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same result can be obtained by using labs() to specify each label in the graph. For renaming the legend title, the command will depend on what is there within the aes() or in other words what is the legend based on.\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, colour = Species)) +\n  geom_point() + theme_bw() + labs(x = \"Weight (gm)\", y = \"Wing (mm)\", \n  title= \"Weight vs Wing span in three different species of Hawks\", \n  subtitle = \"CH=Cooper's, RT=Red-tailed, SS=Sharp-Shinned\",\n  caption = \"Source: Hawk dataset from Stat2Data r-package\", #caption for the graph\n  colour = \"Hawk Species\", # rename legend title\n  tag = \"A\") #figure tag\n\n\n\n\n\n2.9 Tweaking the axes\n\nUse xlim() and ylim() for limiting x and y axes respectively.\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, colour = Species)) +\n  geom_point() + theme_bw() + xlim(c(0,1000)) + ylim(c(200,350))\n\n\n\n\n\nUse coord_cartesian() to zoom in on a particular area in the graph\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, colour = Species)) +\n  geom_point() + theme_bw() + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,1000),\n                                                   ylim = c(200,350))\n\n\n\n\n\nUse coord_flip() to flip the x and y axes.\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, colour = Species)) +\n  geom_point() + theme_bw() + coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nUse scale_x_continuous() for tweaking the x-axis. The same command work for the y-axis also. You can include label() inside the command to manually label the breaks of the axes.\n\n\nShow the codelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, colour = Species)) +\n  geom_point() + theme_bw() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1000,2000))\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the codelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, colour = Species)) +\n  geom_point() + theme_bw() + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1000,2000),label = c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nUse scale_y_reverse() to display the y values in the descending order. Same command applies to x-axis also.\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\n\nggplot(data = Hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, colour = Species)) +\n  geom_point() + theme_bw() + scale_y_reverse()"

I have seen it in almost all the scientific papers that I have read and I know that it is a result obtained after hypothesis testing. And if the value is less 0.05 then the we accept the alternate hypothesis and reject the null hypothesis. I thought that was it, until I found out about the real deal about p-value.\nA study published on 2007 surveyed medical researchers and asked them “what is interpretation on p > 0.05 ?” and thankfully they had the choice to select the answer from four choices. The choices were;\n\nThe chances are greater than 1 in 20 that a difference would be found again if the study were repeated.\nThe probability is less than 1 in 20 that a difference this large could occur by chance alone.\nThe probability is greater than 1 in 20 that a difference this large could occur by chance alone.\nThe chance is 95% that the study is correct.\n\nWhat do you think is the answer if you could answer now?\nAnyway, around 60% of the participants of the survey selected choice 3 and 100% of them were wrong.\nYes, all of them answered wrong! which means there was no right answer among the choices to begin, yes betrayal indeed!

Erratum in: Semin Hematol. 2011 Oct;48(4):302. PMID: 18582619. Link\nNow even after knowing this definition, sometimes it might not be enough. So let us try to see some of the common misconceptions regarding p-value which is beautifully written in the paper ‘A dirty dozen: twelve p-value misconceptions.’ by Goodman S. I will be summarising the content of the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisconception 1\n\n\n\n\nIf p = 0.05, the null hypothesis has only a 5% chance of being true.\n\nIf p = 0.05, by definition it means that there is a 5% chance that we get the observed result plus more extreme results, given that the null hypothesis is true. Therefore by definition, we never say anything about the chance of the null hypothesis being true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisconception 2\n\n\n\n\nA non significant difference (eg, p > 0.05) means there is no difference between groups.\n\np-value as we now know is a probability value. Therefore we cannot conclude anything with absolute certainty like mentioned above saying that ‘there is no difference between the groups’. The takeaway message is that the result that, “there is no difference between the groups” is statistically significant within the level of significance we have chosen and falls within the range of results we should expect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisconception 3\n\n\n\n\nStatistical significance means biological significance.\n\nThis does not need to be always the case. A drug effect experimented with within a large sample size can yield significant p-values but still be not good enough to be used for a cure. This is because the p-value does not tell you anything about the magnitude of the effect. Effect size, which is independent of sample size is a better measure to determine biological significance. We will see effect sizes in detail later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisconception 4\n\n\n\n\nStudies with p values on opposite sides of 0.05 are conflicting.\n\nA better way to see if two results are conflicting is by comparing the confidence intervals of the data. If they do not overlap and have little overlap, then they can be considered conflicting with each other. Two studies looking at the same result can have conflicting p-values because of the differences in sample sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisconception 5\n\n\n\n\nStudies with the same p value provide the same evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\nTwo different results can be statistically significant and have same the p-value. But it is not necessary that they yield the same evidence against the null hypothesis. Consider two studies, where each of them test a novel drug against a disease. The null hypothesis for these studies would be that the cure rate of the drugs would be zero. Let us imagine that the first study had a cure rate of 5% and the second study have 15% cure rate and both studies have the same p-value of 0.05. Now here, both studies are able to reject the null hypothesis but, they don’t show the same evidence against the null hypothesis, as the second study shows higher cure rate compared to first. As mentioned before the p-value does not convey any information about the magnitude of effect in question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisconception 6\n\n\n\n\np = 0.05 means that we have observed data that would occur only 5% of the time under the null hypothesis.\n\nFrom the definition of the p-value, we know that this statement is incomplete. If \\alpha = 0.05 and p = 0.05, then what it means is that this is the highest probability value at which the observed results or more extreme results occur, given that the null hypothesis is true. If the above statement also mentioned about the occurrence of more extreme results than the observed data then it would be a correct statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisconception 7\n\n\n\n\np = 0.05 and p ≤ 0.05 mean the same thing.\n\nNow, this would be the most confusing one out of all the misconceptions that are described in this post. In the paper that I referenced for this article, they don’t give any explanation other than saying to explain this difference one would need to use the “Bayesian evidence metric”. So after reading about it this is my understanding of it.\nWe can calculate the “likelihood” for a hypothesis(H) for a given data(x) which is expressed as L(H|x). The expression is the same as that of a conditional probability, but since we are dealing with hypotheses we use the word likelihood and if it was results, we associate it with probability. Also, L(H|x) is directly proportional to P(x|H), where P(x|H) is the probability of obtaining data(x) given hypothesis(H) is true. Now for null(Ho) and alternate hypothesis (Ha), we have;\n\nL(Ho|x) \\propto P(x|Ho)\nL(Ha|x) \\propto P(x|Ha)\n\nNow likelihood ratio (LR) is calculated as;\nLR = L(Ha|x) / L(Ho|x) = P(x|Ha) / P(x|Ho)\nHere P(x|H) can be probabilities or probability densities.\nNow let us try to understand the difference between p = 0.05 and p ≤ 0.05.\n\n\nFig1: Probability distribution curves for Ha and Ho.

(1993)\n\n\nConsider the figure given above.\nFor p = 0.05, we will have;\nLR = P(x|Ha) / P(x|Ho) = P(A)/P(o)\nwhere P(A) is the probability at B for curve Ha and P(o) is the probability at A for curve Ho.\nand for p ≤ 0.05, we will have;\nLR = P(x|Ha) / P(x|Ho) = Shaded\\;area/Striped\\;area\nwhere the shaded area is the probability density for p ≤ 0.05 in curve Ha and the striped area is the probability density for p ≤ 0.05 in curve Ho.\nNow for p values between 0.05 to 0.001;\nP(A)/P(o) < Shaded\\;area/Striped\\;area\nwhich means, for p = 0.05 we have less evidence for the alternate hypothesis as opposed to when p ≤ 0.05. Therefore p = 0.05 and p ≤ 0.05 are different from each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisconception 8\n\n\n\n\np values are properly written as inequalities (eg, “P ≤ 0.02” when P = 0.015)\n\nWhile showing p-values in results, it is always a thumb rule to denote the actual value rather than denoting them as an inequality. For example, for \\alpha=0.05, a result displaying p = 0.04 is far more useful, when compared to displaying it as p ≤ 0.05 as we know that the p-value is barely on the edge of the level of significance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisconception 9\n\n\n\n\np = 0.05 means that if you reject the null hypothesis, the probability of a type I error is only 5%.\n\nType I error also called false-positive is when we accept that there is some effect when in reality there is none. Now the definition of p-value is that it is the probability of obtaining the observed effect plus more extreme effects, given that the null hypothesis is true. Therefore for type, I error to happen, the null hypothesis has to be true. So if we reject the null hypothesis, then the chance of type I error is zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisconception 10\n\n\n\n\nWith p = 0.05 threshold for significance(\\alpha), the chance of a type I error will be 5%.\n\nIf our p = \\alpha = 0.05, then we reject the null hypothesis. In doing so, we are allowing ourselves the chance of error that there is a 5% chance that the null hypothesis is true. Do not get confused by definitions of p-value and \\alpha. Having p = 0.05 and setting \\alpha = 0.05 are two different things. Therefore \\alpha can also be termed as the probability that a type I error occurs. So when does this statement becomes a misconception?\nFor multiple pairwise comparisons, this concept is not true. For \\alpha = 0.05, the new \\alpha for n tests is equal to;\n\\alpha' = 1 - (1-\\alpha)^n = 1 - (1-0.05)^n\nTherefore even if we had set \\alpha = 0.05 prior, after multiple comparisons the resultant \\alpha' will be a greater value. This is also called as multiple comparison problem and it is corrected through methods called as multiple comparison corrections. You can learn more about this in Chapter 9."

    "text": "1 Distribution and variance\nLet us look at the penguins dataset from the palmerpenguins package in R. We will plot the distribution curve for “body mass” of the “Chinstrap” species of penguins.\n\nCode#install.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\npenguins %>% filter(species == \"Chinstrap\") %>% ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g)) + \n  xlab(\"Body Mass (g)\") + ylab(\"Density\") + ggtitle(\"Body mass distribution\") + \n  geom_density(fill = \"darkred\") + \n  labs(subtitle = paste0(\"N=\",penguins %>% filter(species == \"Chinstrap\") %>% nrow())) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the data distribution closely resembles a “bell-shaped” curve. This kind of distribution is known as a normal distribution or a Gaussian distribution. On closer look, you can also see that the area under the curve is almost symmetrical to both sides and there is only a single peak present. We can also learn about the variance of the data by looking at the width of the curve. A wider curve means variance is higher and a narrower curve means variance in the data is smaller. Also for a normal distribution, there are no visible outliers present in the plot. Outliers are those data points which fall out of the normal trend in the data. The peak represents the mean of the data.\n\nCodelibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\n# Create function to get mode\ngetmode <- function(v) {\n   uniqv <- unique(v)\n   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]\n}\n\npen_avg <- penguins %>% filter(species == \"Chinstrap\") %>% summarise(mean = mean(body_mass_g),\n                                                          median = median(body_mass_g),\n                                                          mode = getmode(body_mass_g))\n\npenguins %>% filter(species == \"Chinstrap\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g)) + \n  xlab(\"Body Mass (g)\") + ylab(\"Density\") + ggtitle(\"Body mass distribution\") + \n  geom_density(fill = \"grey\") + \n  labs(subtitle = paste0(\"N=\",penguins %>% filter(species == \"Chinstrap\") %>% nrow())) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = pen_avg$mean, colour = \"red\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=pen_avg$mean, label=\"mean\", y=4e-04), colour=\"red\", angle=90, vjust = 1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = pen_avg$median, colour = \"blue\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=pen_avg$median, label=\"median\", y=4e-04), colour=\"blue\", angle=90, vjust = -1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +\ngeom_vline(aes(xintercept = pen_avg$mode, colour = \"green\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=pen_avg$mode, label=\"mode\", y=4e-04), colour=\"green\", angle=90, vjust = -1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +\n  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\nFor a normal distribution the mean, median and mode are all the same value and are in the middle of the curve. From the plot above you can see that all the averages are almost the same. In general all three modes of averages tries to represent the centre of the dataset for any distribution. With that said some mode of average is preferred over others in terms of the nature of the distribution, we will see what it means later on.\nNow let us look the same distribution but for “Gentoo” species of penguins.\n\nCode#install.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\npenguins %>% filter(species == \"Gentoo\") %>% ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g)) + \n  xlab(\"Body Mass (g)\") + ylab(\"Density\") + ggtitle(\"Body mass distribution\") + \n  geom_density(fill = \"darkblue\") + \n  labs(subtitle = paste0(\"N=\",penguins %>% filter(species == \"Gentoo\") %>% nrow())) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the previous curve this one has two peaks. This kind of curve is an example for a “bimodal distribution”. Now what would have caused these two peaks to form in this one but not in the first one? So we can guess that there is some hidden variable that is affecting the body mass distribution of Gentoo penguins. What about the ‘sex’ of the penguins? Will that have any effect? Let us try plotting the same plot but in terms of the sex of the penguins.\n\nCode#install.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\npenguins %>% filter(species == \"Gentoo\") %>% drop_na() %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = sex)) + \n  xlab(\"Body Mass (g)\") + ylab(\"Density\") + ggtitle(\"Body mass distribution\") + \n  geom_density() + \n  labs(subtitle = paste0(\"N=\",penguins %>% filter(species == \"Gentoo\") %>% nrow())) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nHa! We were spot on! So it looks like male Gentoos are generally larger in comparison to females.\nNow let us consider the plot given below.\n\nCode#install.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\ndiamonds %>% filter(cut == \"Fair\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = carat)) + \n  xlab(\"carats\") + ylab(\"Density\") + ggtitle(\"Diamond carat distribution\") + \n  geom_density(fill = \"gold\") + \n  labs(subtitle = paste0(\"N=\",diamonds %>% filter(cut == \"Fair\") %>% nrow())) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a “skewed distribution”. Moreover, this is a “right-skewed distribution”, why is it called right-skewed? Look at the same plot below.\n\nCode#install.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\n# Create function to get mode\ngetmode <- function(v) {\n   uniqv <- unique(v)\n   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]\n}\n\ndiamonds %>% filter(cut == \"Fair\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = carat)) + \n  xlab(\"carats\") + ylab(\"Density\") + ggtitle(\"Diamond carat distribution\") + \n  geom_density(fill = \"gold\") + \n  labs(subtitle = paste0(\"N=\",diamonds %>% filter(cut == \"Fair\") %>% nrow())) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(diamonds$carat), colour = \"red\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=mean(diamonds$carat), label=\"mean\", y=1), colour=\"red\", angle=90, vjust = 1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(diamonds$carat), colour = \"blue\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=median(diamonds$carat), label=\"median\", y=1), colour=\"blue\", angle=90, vjust = -1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +\ngeom_vline(aes(xintercept = getmode(diamonds$carat), colour = \"green\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=getmode(diamonds$carat), label=\"mode\", y=1), colour=\"green\", angle=90, vjust = -1.2, text=element_text(size=11)) +\n  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\nI have plotted the mean, median, and mode values for the plot and you can see that the mean value is more than the mode value. This is why the curve is indicated as right-skewed, as the mean is skewed towards the right side of the mode value. If it was the other way around then the curve will be called “left-skewed”. Also in this case, if we had used the mean value to represent the dataset it would have been a poor choice and you see that the median is a better choice compared to the mean. Therefore when the dataset is skewed, the median is the better choice to represent the dataset. The mode will be best suited for datasets with a lot of repeated values.\n\n\nFig1: Types of distributions. Credits: biologyforlife.com"

    "section": "\n2 What is tidy data?",
    "text": "2 What is tidy data?\nFirst, we need to understand what tidy data looks like. For that let us imagine a scenario where you are a doctor who is trying to find the best treatment for a disease. Now your colleagues have short-listed five different treatment methods and have reported their efficacy values when tested with five different patients. Now you are tasked with finding which of the five treatments is the best against the disease. You open your computer and you find the following data of the experiment.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis is how often data is stored because it is easy to write it this way. In the first column, you can see the different treatments from one to five. And in the second column, you have the efficacy values of the treatments for patient 1 and it goes on for the other patients. Now, this is a good example of how a dataset should not look like! Surprised? Let us see what makes this dataset ‘dirty’.\nYou can quickly notice that there is no mentioning of what these numerical values mean. Of course, we know that they are efficacy values for the different treatments. But for someone who only has this data as a reference, that person would not have a clue as to what these numbers mean. Also, note that each of the rows contains multiple observation values which is not a feature of tidy data. This kind of data format is called ‘wide data’ which we will talk more about later.\nWith that being said, tidy data will have;\n\nEach of its variables represented in its own column\nEach observation or a case in its own row.\nEach of the rows will contain only a single value.\n\nSo let us see how the ‘tidier’ version of this data would look like.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nYou can see each of the columns represent only one type of variable. In the first column, you have the types of treatments, followed by patient IDs and their efficacy values for each treatment. Also, note that each row represents only one observation. So this kind of data format is what we strive to achieve by using the tidyr package and they are called as ‘long data’. So let us begin!"

    "section": "\n3 Reshaping dataset",
    "text": "3 Reshaping dataset\nThere are different sets of commands which you can utilize to reshape your data and make it tidy. Let us each of these commands in action. But first, make sure you have the tidyr package loaded.\n\nCode# load tidyr package\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n\n\n3.1 pivot_longer()\nThe pivot_longer() command converts a ‘wide data’ to a ‘long data’. It does so by converting row names to a new column under a new variable name with its corresponding values moved into another column with another variable name. So let us see how it goes. We will take the earlier mentioned example and will see how to make it tidy. Now you don’t have to be concerned with the codes I have used to make the dummy data. Just have your focus on the pivot_longer() syntax.\n\nCodelibrary(tidyr)\n# making a dummy data\n# using sample function to pick random numbers in a sequence\npatient1 <- c(seq(1,5,1))\npatient2 <- c(seq(6,10,1))\npatient3 <- c(seq(11,15,1))\npatient4 <- c(seq(16,20,1))\npatient5 <- c(seq(21,25,1))\n\n# cbind simple combines the columns of same size\ntreatment_data <- cbind(patient1,patient2,patient3,patient4,patient5) \n\ntrt <- c(\"treatment1\", \"treatment2\",\"treatment3\",\"treatment4\",\"treatment5\")\n\ntrt_data <- cbind(trt, treatment_data)\ntrt_data <- as.data.frame(trt_data) # making it a data frame\n\ntrt_data_tidy <- pivot_longer(trt_data,\n                              c(patient1,patient2,patient3,patient4,patient5), \n                              names_to = \"patient_ID\", values_to = \"efficacy\")\nrmarkdown::paged_table(trt_data_tidy)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFurthermore, you don’t have to manually type in the column names as you can use colnames() to call the column names of the dataset. Another way of doing the same is by excluding the first column from the process. By doing so the command will automatically pivot all columns except the excluded ones, so in this way, we don’t need to manually specify the column names. The codes given below will give you the same result as before.\n\nShow the codelibrary(tidyr)\npatient1 <- c(seq(1,5,1))\npatient2 <- c(seq(6,10,1))\npatient3 <- c(seq(11,15,1))\npatient4 <- c(seq(16,20,1))\npatient5 <- c(seq(21,25,1))\ntreatment_data <- cbind(patient1,patient2,patient3,patient4,patient5) \ntreatment <- c(\"treatment1\", \"treatment2\",\"treatment3\",\"treatment4\",\"treatment5\")\ntrt_data <- cbind(treatment, treatment_data)\ntrt_data <- as.data.frame(trt_data)\n# using colnames, [-1] is included to exclude the name of first column from the process\ntrt_data_tidy1 <- pivot_longer(trt_data,\n                              colnames(trt_data)[-1], \n                              names_to = \"patient_ID\", values_to = \"efficacy\")\n\n# the same can be done by manually specifying which columns to exclude\n# this can be done by denoting the column name ('treatment' in this case) with '-' sign\ntrt_data_tidy2 <- pivot_longer(trt_data, names_to = \"patient_ID\",\n                               values_to = \"efficacy\", -treatment)\n# checking if both the tidy datasets are one and the same\ntrt_data_tidy1 == trt_data_tidy2\n\n\nThe syntax for pivot_longer() is given below with description\n\nCodepivot_longer(\"data\", c(\"colname1, colname2,.....\"), \n  names_to = \"name of the column where your row names are present\",\n  values_to = \"name of the column where your corresponding row values are present\")\n\n\nHere is a graphical representation\n\n\n3.2 pivot_wider()\nThe pivot_wider() does the exact opposite of what pivot_longer() does, which is to convert long data into wide data. We will use the previously given dummy data.\n\nCodelibrary(tidyr)\n# making a dummy data\n# using sample function to pick random numbers in a sequence\npatient1 <- c(seq(1,5,1))\npatient2 <- c(seq(6,10,1))\npatient3 <- c(seq(11,15,1))\npatient4 <- c(seq(16,20,1))\npatient5 <- c(seq(21,25,1))\n\n# cbind simple combines the columns of same size\ntreatment_data <- cbind(patient1,patient2,patient3,patient4,patient5) \n\ntrt <- c(\"treatment1\", \"treatment2\",\"treatment3\",\"treatment4\",\"treatment5\")\n\ntrt_data <- cbind(trt, treatment_data)\ntrt_data <- as.data.frame(trt_data) # making it a data frame\n\ntrt_data_tidy <- pivot_longer(trt_data,\n                              c(patient1,patient2,patient3,patient4,patient5), \n                              names_to = \"patient_ID\", values_to = \"efficacy\")\n\n# making the data wide\ntrt_data_wider <- pivot_wider(trt_data_tidy, names_from = \"patient_ID\",\n                              values_from = \"efficacy\")\n\n# paged_Table() for viewing the dataset as a table, \n# you can see that the dataset is same as before\nrmarkdown::paged_table(trt_data_wider)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe syntax for pivot_wider() is given below with description\n\nCodepivot_longer(\"data\", \n  names_from = \"name of the column which contains your wide data columns\",\n  values_from = \"name of the column where your corresponding wide data column values are\")\n\n\nHere is a graphical representation"

    "text": "2 The pipe operator %>%\nPerhaps the most amazing thing in making codes short and efficient is the pipe operator which is originally from the magrittr package which is made available for the dplyr package. The pipe operator helps you skip the intermediate steps of saving an object before you can use them in command. It does so by ‘piping’ together results from the first object to the function ahead of the pipe operator. The command x %>% y %>% z can be read as ‘take the result of x and use it with function y and take that result and use it with function z’. This is the gist of what the pipe operator does. Allow me to demonstrate.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# dummy data\na <- c(sample(1:100, size = 50))\nb <- c(sample(1:100, size = 50))\ndata <- as.data.frame(cbind(a,b))\n\n# without %>%\ndata <- mutate(data, ab = a*b, twice_a = 2*a)\ndata_new <- filter(data, ab < 300, twice_a < 200)\nggplot(data_new, aes(ab, twice_a)) + geom_point()\n\n# with %>%\ndata %>% mutate(ab = a*b, twice_a = 2*a) %>% \n  filter(ab < 300, twice_a < 200) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(ab, twice_a)) + geom_point()\n\nAs you can see, with pipe operator %>%, we did not have to save any objects in the intermediate steps and also it improved the overall clarity of the code. I have used a few commands from the dplyr package in the example given above. So without further ado let us delve into the dplyr package. For this chapter, I will be using the penguin dataset from the popular {palmerpenguin} package as an example.\n\n# install palmerpenguins package\ninstall.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)"

In short, you should use it whenever you want any function to act separately on different groups present in the dataset. Here is a graphical representation of how the summarise() function is used to calculate the mean values of a dataset. When used with group_by() it calculates mean values for the respective groups in the data, but when group_by() is not used, it will calculate the mean value of the entire dataset irrespective of the different groups present and outputs a single column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 count()\nThe count() command is used to count the number of rows of a variable.

First example shows across() used with summarise() function.\n\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\n# summarise across columns body mass, bill length and bill depth\n# and calculate the mean values\n# since we are calculating mean values,\n# NAs are dropped using 'drop_na() function from 'tidyr' package\n\npaged_table(penguins %>% drop_na() %>%\n  group_by(species) %>%\n  summarise(across(c(body_mass_g, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm), mean)))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSecond example showing across() used with mutate() function. We can efficiently create new columns using mutate() and across() together. Suppose we want to multiply all numerical values in a dataset with 2 and create new columns of those values. This can be done using the code below.\n\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\n# define the function\ntwo_times <- function(x) {\n  2*x\n} \n\n# .name will rename the new columns with 'twice` prefix combined with existing col names\npaged_table(penguins %>% group_by(species) %>%\n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), two_times, .names = \"two_times_{col}\")))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe same code when used just with mutate() function will look like this\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\n# define the function\ntwo_times <- function(x) {\n  2*x\n}\n\n# using only 'mutate()' function\npenguins %>% group_by(species) %>%\n  mutate(twice_bill_lenght = two_times(bill_length_mm),\n         twice_body_mass = two_times(body_mass_g),\n         .....)\n\nSo in this code, I will have to manually type all the col names and apply the operation individually which is too much of a hassle. Now we can better appreciate how efficient it is in using mutate() and across() functions together.\n\n6.8 c_across()\nThe function c_across() is similar to the earlier mentioned across() function. But instead of doing a column-wise function, it applies function across columns in a row-wise manner. Now, most functions in R by default computes across columns, so to specify row-wise computation, we have to explicitly use the function rowwise() in conjunction with other functions. In the example below we will sum both bill and flipper lengths of the penguins in the penguins dataset and create a new column called ‘sum_of_lengths’.\n\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\npaged_table(penguins %>% drop_na() %>%\n  group_by(species) %>%\n  rowwise() %>%\n  transmute(sum_of_length = sum(c_across(c(bill_length_mm,flipper_length_mm)))))"

    "section": "My Notion story",
    "text": "My Notion story\nMy journey in discovering Notion came from my quest to find software that can track the research papers that I read. Naturally for this purpose, I began to use a reference manager software, Zotero, which is free to use and is open source. Zotero even comes in with a build-in pdf reader which you can use to highlight, comment and insert notes within a research paper This was very helpful as it enabled me to write my thoughts about the paper and summarize its results, which can be helpful if you are writing a research paper for yourself where you will be citing other papers. But soon I realized a big problem. The problem is that Zotero does not provide a clean user interface to show the summary notes I made on a research paper. What I was looking for was a tabular interface which had columns titled ‘title of the paper’, which is followed by the ‘summary’ column, where I list down a summary of the paper as bullet points. The rest of the columns can contain other relevant information about the paper.\n\n\nThe table interface I was looking for\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nAuthors\nDate added\nYear of publication\nSummary\nURL\n\n\nGlyphosate impairs collective thermoregulation in bumblebees\n(Weidenmüller et al., 2022)\n22-June-2022\n2022\n1. Glyphosate sugar water reduced life expectancy of worker bees  2. Glyphosate affected bees invest less time in incubating the brood\nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf7482\n\n\n\nNow Zotero is not expected to have features like this simply because it is a reference manager and not a note-taking application. So I began looking for an application which can provide this exact feature. A simple Google search lead me to people suggesting Microsoft Excel and Google docs as their note-taking apps for summarizing the research papers they read. It sure works but is extremely cumbersome. You have to manually fill in all the columns and that is unnecessary work. Also, it’s not an elegant way of categorizing the data. I wanted something highly customizable and at the same time automated to an extent. Something similar to Zotero, where you can just simply add the pdf file of a research article and it automatically populates relevant details like Title, Authors, Year etc by grabbing information from the internet. And to my surprise, I came across a tweet on Twitter which had exactly what I was looking for. Thank you @thoughtsofaphd for that tweet.\n\n\n\nLiterature Tracker 2.0: Create a FREE customizable database in @airtable for keeping track of all the papers you download (and maybe read😂). Please share if you find it helpful!⚡️Here’s an easy step-by-step guide: https://t.co/jBQ0XeQahgcc @AcademicChatter pic.twitter.com/jLAkIlM2wQ\n\n— thoughtsofaphd (@thoughtsofaphd) January 7, 2022\n\nIn the tweet I learned about a new software called as Airtable and by following the guide given in the tweet, I made myself a literature tracker for managing the summaries of the papers I read.\n\n\n\nMy literature tracker template in Airtable\n\n\n\nEverything was going smoothly and I was in love with the new user interface Airtable provided. But I was still annoyed by the fact that I have to manually type in the basic information like “name of the paper”, “authors name” etc. and quite frankly it was becoming quite tedious as the number of papers in my collection grew in number. Humans aren’t meant to write standard titles. If there was some way to connect Zotero to Airtable that would have made my life easy. So upon searching for a solution I came to know that there is an integration feature developed by Avana Vana. But upon reading about the feature on Github I quickly realized that it was beyond my current ability to comprehend what was happening and how to implement it. So I did what any honest person would have done after that. I gave up on Airtable and went to look for an alternative. And that’s how I came to meet Notion!\nAs I began learning about Notion I quickly realized the rich potential it offered. Initially, I just wanted a tabular database where I could efficiently write down the summaries of the papers that I read. But upon seeing how others use Notion in their daily life, I couldn’t help myself to try those features, expand on them and implement them in my day-to-day activities. So after putting in some hours in learning Notion, I was able to create a beautiful template which housed a database storing all the details of the papers I read. In addition to this template, I also made a few other ones focusing on various other day-to-day activities.\n\n\n\nMy literature tracker template in Notion\n\n\n\nThis new template is a significantly improved version of the Airtable template I had before. One of the best improvements was that this one is now automated. So no more wasting time by manually typing words in boring columns. With the help of the plugin Notero by David Vanoni, you can seamlessly integrate your Zotero literature collection with your workspace in Notion. This plugin was a game-changer for me. And thus began my Notion journey starting from this literature tracker template. In addition to this literature tracker template, I also made a few other ones focusing on various other day-to-day activities. If you are interested in how to use the template in Notion and how to get them, I have written separate articles, focusing on each of these templates. You can learn more about this at the end of this article."

    "text": "Do you need Notion?\nConsider Notion as a LEGO set that you had when you were a child. You can build almost anything with Notion and it is tailored to give you a personal Wiki experience. You are mostly only limited by your creativity and needs. The learning curve for Notion is not a hard one and it’s pretty much self-intuitive. Whatever I was able to do until now required only a week of self-learning. With that said you can also get a wide variety of templates, mostly for free which can satisfy most of your needs. Most features of Notion are free for personal use but they also have different subscription-based plans for advanced power users. You can learn more about their plans here. Also, keep in mind that you need an active internet connection to use Notion.\nNow let us answer the elephant in the room. Is it secure? The answer is yes and no. Notion uses encryption to encrypt data when it is been sent and received between the user and Notion. But created databases that are stored in Notion’s cloud service are not encrypted. This means employees of Notion can access your data. Notion has a strict data security policy and claims that they will only access user data with prior permission from the users themselves. The reason why they don’t use end-to-end encryption is because it would make certain features like ‘full-text search’ impossible to implement. As for Notion’s data security commitment, they are part of the Security First Initiative which pledges to put security first by sharing their security information proactively with their customers. So in my opinion I think it’s safe to use Notion unless you create tables containing your credit card info or account passwords. If you are a researcher, I would also recommend that you do not attach any sensitive research data to Notion. With over 30 million users and with strong ideals on user security and data protection, Notion is as good as any other productive software like Slack, Evernote etc. in terms of data security. So I don’t think you will face any problem when adopting Notion for your daily activities."

You can use your Gmail account for a quick sign-in.\nNotion can be used from your browser itself. But if you want to work from your desktop, please install the desktop app.\nNow you are ready to use Notion.\n\nIt can be pretty overwhelming at first, but as soon as you get familiar, you will learn to do cool new stuff with it,ṁ.k. There are many YouTube videos and web articles that will walk you through the basics of Notion. A good place to start is by watching this YouTube video by Notion itself where they introduce the basics of Notion.\n\n\nNow my goal is to not make you watch multiple tutorial videos and bore yourself to death. Instead, I would like you to have a goal in mind. How I came to learn Notion is that, as I mentioned before, I wanted to have a ‘literature tracker’, so having a goal sets me up to see which features in Notion would help me build it. As Notion has a lot of features it can be too much on your plate in trying to learn about all these features. So proceed to go goal by goal. Rome wasn’t built in a single day! If you are learning any new skill it’s always helpful to visualize why you are learning this skill and what you want to use it for? A sense of purpose can make the learning process more enjoyable and satisfying in the end.\nNow I am aspiring to be a researcher, so naturally, that made me interested in using Notion for what would be my plausible PhD journey in the future. For this reason, I have made a couple of templates tailored to ease up my workflow when I start my PhD. At the time of writing this article, I am using Notion as a literature tracker, research diary (I will start using it once I get a PhD position), task manager, movie and book list tracker and as a simple finance tracker. If any of these templates interest you, then you are lucky as I have made all of them free for use! Furthermore, I have also written tutorials for some of these templates which you can read and get a better idea of how to use them."

    "text": "My Notion story\nMy journey in discovering Notion came from my quest to find software that can track the research papers that I read. Naturally for this purpose, I began to use a reference manager software, Zotero, which is free to use and is open source. Zotero even comes in with a build-in pdf reader which you can use to highlight, comment and insert notes within a research paper This was very helpful as it enabled me to write my thoughts about the paper and summarize its results, which can be helpful if you are writing a research paper for yourself where you will be citing other papers. But soon I realized a big problem. The problem is that Zotero does not provide a clean user interface to show the summary notes I made on a research paper. What I was looking for was a tabular interface which had columns titled ‘title of the paper’, which is followed by the ‘summary’ column, where I list down a summary of the paper as bullet points. The rest of the columns can contain other relevant information about the paper.\n\n\nThe table interface I was looking for\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nAuthors\nDate added\nYear of publication\nSummary\nURL\n\n\nGlyphosate impairs collective thermoregulation in bumblebees\n(Weidenmüller et al., 2022)\n22-June-2022\n2022\n1. Glyphosate sugar water reduced life expectancy of worker bees  2. Glyphosate affected bees invest less time in incubating the brood\nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf7482\n\n\n\nNow Zotero is not expected to have features like this simply because it is a reference manager and not a note-taking application. So I began looking for an application which can provide this exact feature. A simple Google search lead me to people suggesting Microsoft Excel and Google docs as their note-taking apps for summarizing the research papers they read. It sure works but is extremely cumbersome. You have to manually fill in all the columns and that is unnecessary work. Also, it’s not an elegant way of categorizing the data. I wanted something highly customizable and at the same time automated to an extent. Something similar to Zotero, where you can just simply add the pdf file of a research article and it automatically populates relevant details like Title, Authors, Year etc by grabbing information from the internet. And to my surprise, I came across a tweet on Twitter which had exactly what I was looking for. Thank you @thoughtsofaphd for that tweet.\n\n\n\nLiterature Tracker 2.0: Create a FREE customizable database in @airtable for keeping track of all the papers you download (and maybe read😂). Please share if you find it helpful!⚡️Here’s an easy step-by-step guide: https://t.co/jBQ0XeQahgcc @AcademicChatter pic.twitter.com/jLAkIlM2wQ\n\n— thoughtsofaphd (@thoughtsofaphd) January 7, 2022\n\nIn the tweet I learned about a new software called as Airtable and by following the guide given in the tweet, I made myself a literature tracker for managing the summaries of the papers I read.\n\n\n\nMy literature tracker template in Airtable\n\n\n\nEverything was going smoothly and I was in love with the new user interface Airtable provided. But I was still annoyed by the fact that I have to manually type in the basic information like “name of the paper”, “authors name” etc. and quite frankly it was becoming quite tedious as the number of papers in my collection grew in number. Humans aren’t meant to write standard titles. If there was some way to connect Zotero to Airtable that would have made my life easy. So upon searching for a solution I came to know that there is an integration feature developed by Avana Vana. But upon reading about the feature on Github I quickly realized that it was beyond my current ability to comprehend what was happening and how to implement it. So I did what any honest person would have done after that. I gave up on Airtable and went to look for an alternative. And that’s how I came to meet Notion!\nAs I began learning about Notion I quickly realized the rich potential it offered. Initially, I just wanted a tabular database where I could efficiently write down the summaries of the papers that I read. But upon seeing how others use Notion in their daily life, I couldn’t help myself to try those features, expand on them and implement them in my day-to-day activities. So after putting in some hours in learning Notion, I was able to create a beautiful template which housed a database storing all the details of the papers I read. In addition to this template, I also made a few other ones focusing on various other day-to-day activities.\n\n\n\nMy literature tracker template in Notion\n\n\n\nThis new template is a significantly improved version of the Airtable template I had before. One of the best improvements was that this one is now automated. So no more wasting time by manually typing words in boring columns. With the help of the plugin Notero by David Vanoni, you can seamlessly integrate your Zotero literature collection with your workspace in Notion. This plugin was a game-changer for me. And thus began my Notion journey starting from this literature tracker template. In addition to this literature tracker template, I also made a few other ones focusing on various other day-to-day activities. If you are interested in how to use the template in Notion and how to get them, I have written separate articles, focusing on each of these templates. You can learn more about this at the end of this article."

    "text": "Do you need Notion?\nConsider Notion as a LEGO set that you had when you were a child. You can build almost anything with Notion and it is tailored to give you a personal Wiki experience. You are mostly only limited by your creativity and needs. The learning curve for Notion is not a hard one and it’s pretty much self-intuitive. Whatever I was able to do until now required only a week of self-learning. With that said you can also get a wide variety of templates, mostly for free which can satisfy most of your needs. Most features of Notion are free for personal use but they also have different subscription-based plans for advanced power users. You can learn more about their plans here. Also, keep in mind that you need an active internet connection to use Notion.\nNow let us answer the elephant in the room. Is it secure? The answer is yes and no. Notion uses encryption to encrypt data when it is been sent and received between the user and Notion. But created databases that are stored in Notion’s cloud service are not encrypted. This means employees of Notion can access your data. Notion has a strict data security policy and claims that they will only access user data with prior permission from the users themselves. The reason why they don’t use end-to-end encryption is because it would make certain features like ‘full-text search’ impossible to implement. As for Notion’s data security commitment, they are part of the Security First Initiative which pledges to put security first by sharing their security information proactively with their customers. So in my opinion I think it’s safe to use Notion unless you create tables containing your credit card info or account passwords. If you are a researcher, I would also recommend that you do not attach any sensitive research data to Notion. With over 30 million users and with strong ideals on user security and data protection, Notion is as good as any other productive software like Slack, Evernote etc. in terms of data security. So I don’t think you will face any problem when adopting Notion for your daily activities."

    "text": "Installing Notion\nIf you are interested to try out Notion and seeing if it works for you, then please follow these steps.\n\nGo to Notion website and sign up for a free account. You can use your Gmail account for a quick sign-in.\nNotion can be used from your browser itself. But if you want to work from your desktop, please install the desktop app.\nNow you are ready to use Notion.\n\nIt can be pretty overwhelming at first, but as soon as you get familiar, you will learn to do cool new stuff with it,ṁ.k. There are many YouTube videos and web articles that will walk you through the basics of Notion. A good place to start is by watching this YouTube video by Notion itself where they introduce the basics of Notion.\n\n\nNow my goal is to not make you watch multiple tutorial videos and bore yourself to death. Instead, I would like you to have a goal in mind. How I came to learn Notion is that, as I mentioned before, I wanted to have a ‘literature tracker’, so having a goal sets me up to see which features in Notion would help me build it. As Notion has a lot of features it can be too much on your plate in trying to learn about all these features. So proceed to go goal by goal. Rome wasn’t built in a single day! If you are learning any new skill it’s always helpful to visualize why you are learning this skill and what you want to use it for? A sense of purpose can make the learning process more enjoyable and satisfying in the end.\nNow I am aspiring to be a researcher, so naturally, that made me interested in using Notion for what would be my plausible PhD journey in the future. For this reason, I have made a couple of templates tailored to ease up my workflow when I start my PhD. At the time of writing this article, I am using Notion as a literature tracker, research diary (I will start using it once I get a PhD position), task manager, movie and book list tracker and as a simple finance tracker. If any of these templates interest you, then you are lucky as I have made all of them free for use! Furthermore, I have also written tutorials for some of these templates which you can read and get a better idea of how to use them."
