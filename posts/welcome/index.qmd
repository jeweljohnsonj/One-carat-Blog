## Making of one-carat-blog (second version)

Hello! my name is Jewel Johnson and I am the creator of this blog. The main reason why I made this blog was to have a source of medium for me to write articles in science and share them with the world. This first version of this blog was made using the `{distill}` package in R and you can find the link to it [here](https://jeweljohnsonj.github.io/jeweljohnson.github.io/). From then I moved on and remade the blog using the latest `{quarto}` package in R. This new package proves to be an upgrade from `{distill}` and I am starting to love the new features of it. Since I am also fond of using R, I took it upon me to write a few tutorials focusing on beginners, which you can find in this blog.

Update (26-May-2022): I have also written a few articles on basic statistics and how to do them in R.

## How did I make this blog

There are several well-explained tutorials which explain from scratch how one can build a blog. If you are planning to use `{quarto}` for making your blog, then the quarto website itself features well written beginner friendly tutorials. Apart from that I found two other posts which also proved very useful while creating this blog. The links are given below.
