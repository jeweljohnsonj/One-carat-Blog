	abstract = {▪ Abstract  A small number of prokaryotic species have a unique physiology or ecology related to their development of unusually large size. The biomass of bacteria varies over more than 10 orders of magnitude, from the 0.2 μm wide nanobacteria to the largest cells of the colorless sulfur bacteria, Thiomargarita namibiensis, with a diameter of 750 μm. All bacteria, including those that swim around in the environment, obtain their food molecules by molecular diffusion. Only the fastest and largest swimmers known, Thiovulum majus, are able to significantly increase their food supply by motility and by actively creating an advective flow through the entire population. Diffusion limitation generally restricts the maximal size of prokaryotic cells and provides a selective advantage for μm-sized cells at the normally low substrate concentrations in the environment. The largest heterotrophic bacteria, the 80 × 600 μm large Epulopiscium sp. from the gut of tropical fish, are presumably living in a very nutrient-rich medium. Many large bacteria contain numerous inclusions in the cells that reduce the volume of active cytoplasm. The most striking examples of competitive advantage from large cell size are found among the colorless sulfur bacteria that oxidize hydrogen sulfide to sulfate with oxygen or nitrate. The several-cm-long filamentous species can penetrate up through the ca 500-μm-thick diffusive boundary layer and may thereby reach into water containing their electron acceptor, oxygen or nitrate. By their ability to store vast quantities of both nitrate and elemental sulfur in the cells, these bacteria have become independent of the coexistence of their substrates. In fact, a close relative, T. namibiensis, can probably respire in the sulfidic mud for several months before again filling up their large vacuoles with nitrate.},

	abstract = {Beggiatoaceae, giant sulphur-oxidizing bacteria, are well known to occur in cold and temperate waters, as well as hydrothermal vents, where they form dense mats on the floor. However, they have never been described in tropical marine mangroves. Here, we describe two new species of benthic Beggiatoaceae colonizing a marine mangrove adjacent to mangrove roots. We combined phylogenetic and lipid analysis with electron microscopy in order to describe these organisms. Furthermore, oxygen and sulphide measurements in and ex situ were performed in a mesocosm to characterize their environment. Based on this, two new species, Candidatus Maribeggiatoa sp. and Candidatus Isobeggiatoa sp. inhabiting tropical marine mangroves in Guadeloupe were identified. The species identified as Candidatus Maribeggiatoa group suggests that this genus could harbour a third cluster with organisms ranging from 60 to 120 μm in diameter. This is also the first description of an Isobeggiatoa species outside of Arctic and temperate waters. The multiphasic approach also gives information about the environment and indications for the metabolism of these bacteria. Our study shows the widespread occurrence of members of Beggiatoaceae family and provides new insight in their potential role in shallow-water marine sulphide-rich environments such as mangroves.},

	abstract = {In order to investigate the environmental requirements of the filamentous sulfur bacteria Thioploca spp., we tested the chemotactic responses of these sedimentary microorganisms to changes in oxygen, nitrate, and sulfide concentrations. A sediment core with a Thioploca mat, retrieved from the oxygen-minimum zone on the Chilean shelf, was incubated in a recirculating flume. The addition of 25 (mu)mol of nitrate per liter to the seawater flow induced the ascent of the Thioploca trichomes (length, up to 70 mm) in their mostly vertically oriented gelatinous sheaths. The upper ends of the filaments penetrated the sediment surface and protruded 1 to 3 mm into the flowing water before they bent downstream. By penetrating the diffusive boundary layer, Thioploca spp. facilitate efficient nitrate uptake in exposed trichome sections that are up to 30 mm long. The cumulative length of exposed filaments per square centimeter of sediment surface was up to 92 cm, with a total exposed trichome surface area of 1 cm(sup2). The positive reaction to nitrate overruled a negative response to oxygen, indicating that nitrate is the principal electron acceptor used by Thioploca spp. in the anoxic environment; 10-fold increases in nitrate fluxes after massive emergence of filaments strengthened this hypothesis. A positive chemotactic response to sulfide concentrations of less than 100 (mu)mol liter(sup-1) counteracted the attraction to nitrate and, along with phobic reactions to oxygen and higher sulfide concentrations, controlled the vertical movement of the trichomes. We suggest that the success of Thioploca spp. on the Chilean shelf is based on the ability of these organisms to shuttle between the nitrate-rich boundary layer and the sulfidic sediment strata.},

Over the course of the past two centuries, a wide range of morphological variation within the family Beggiatoaceae has been found. However, representatives of this clade are frequently recalcitrant to current standard microbiological techniques, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing and culturing, and a reliable classification of these bacteria is often complicated.

	abstract = {The absence of genome complexity in prokaryotes, being the evolutionary precursors to eukaryotic cells comprising all complex life (the prokaryote–eukaryote divide), is a long-standing question in evolutionary biology. A previous study hypothesized that the divide exists because prokaryotic genome size is constrained by bioenergetics (prokaryotic power per gene or genome being significantly lower than eukaryotic ones). However, this hypothesis was evaluated using a relatively small dataset due to lack of data availability at the time, and is therefore controversial. Accordingly, we constructed a larger dataset of genomes, metabolic rates, cell sizes and ploidy levels to investigate whether an energetic barrier to genome complexity exists between eukaryotes and prokaryotes while statistically controlling for the confounding effects of cell size and phylogenetic signals. Notably, we showed that the differences in bioenergetics between prokaryotes and eukaryotes were less significant than those previously reported. More importantly, we found a limited contribution of power per genome and power per gene to the prokaryote–eukaryote dichotomy. Our findings indicate that the prokaryote–eukaryote divide is hard to explain from the energetic perspective. However, our findings may not entirely discount the traditional hypothesis; in contrast, they indicate the need for more careful examination.},

	abstract = {The origin of eukaryotic cell size and complexity is thought by some to have required an energy excess provided by mitochondria, whereas others claim that mitochondria provide no energetic boost to eukaryotes. Recent observations show that energy demand scales continuously and linearly with cell volume across both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and thus suggest that eukaryotes do not have an increased energetic capacity over prokaryotes. However, amounts of respiratory membranes and ATP synthases scale super-linearly with cell surface area. Furthermore, the energetic consequences of the contrasting genomic architectures between prokaryotes and eukaryotes have yet to be precisely quantified. Here, we investigated (1) potential factors that affect the cell volumes at which prokaryotes become surface area-constrained, (2) the amount of energy that is divested to increasing amounts of DNA due to the contrasting genomic architectures of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and (3) the costs and benefits of respiring symbionts for a host cell. Our analyses suggest that prokaryotes are not necessarily constrained by their cell surfaces at cell volumes of 100–103 μm3, and that the genomic architecture of eukaryotes is only slightly advantageous at genomes sizes of 106–107 bp. This suggests that eukaryotes may have first evolved without the need for mitochondria as these ranges hypothetically encompass the Last Eukaryote Common Ancestor and its proto-eukaryotic ancestors. At these slightly larger cell volumes, a host cell may also have derived a greater advantage (lower cost) from harboring a population of ATP-producing symbionts. However, our analyses also show that increasingly larger and fast-dividing prokaryotes would have a shortage of surface area devoted to respiration and would disproportionally divest more energy to DNA synthesis at larger genome sizes. We thus argue that, even though mitochondria may not have been required by the first eukaryotes, the successful diversification of eukaryotes into larger and faster-growing cells was ultimately contingent upon the origin of mitochondria.
Significance There has been a lot of theorizing about the evolution of eukaryotes from prokaryotes, but no consensus seems to be on the horizon. Our quantitative analyses on the required amount of respiratory membrane, and the amount of energy diverted to DNA synthesis, by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, suggest that mitochondria provided rather small advantages to the first eukaryotes, but were advantageous for the macro-evolutionary diversification of eukaryotes. This conclusion provides a middle road in the debate between those that claim that the origin of eukaryotes required a massive energy boost provided by mitochondria, and those that argue that the origin of mitochondria did not represent a quantum leap in energetic advantages to eukaryotes.},

Thioploca araucae and Thioploca chileae from the sublittoral soft bottoms of the coastal upwelling ecosystem off central Chile were examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Except for filament diameter (30-43 and 12-20 pm, respectively) and slight differences in other dimensions and surface topology, the details of fine structure were essentially identical in the two species. The wall consisted of five layers, and only the inner layer was present in the septum. Multiple membrane intrusions dissected the procaryotic cytoplasmic material, which was restricted to a relatively thin layer within the wall. Sulfur inclusions and two other extracytoplasmic inclusions, as well as one kind of intracytoplasmic inclusion, were described. The central part of each cell consisted of one large vacuole, extending from septum to septum and representing a volume at least more than three times larger than the combined volume of wall and cytoplasm. The vacuole was separated from the other cell parts by a membrane. Electron-dense material was deposited between vacuole membrane and plasma membrane, between plasma membrane and wall, and inside membrane intrusions. A continuity between the vacuolar membrane and the other membranes was never encountered. The possible origin of such an extracytoplasmic membrane is discussed.},

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is known as a mitochondrial disease. Some even regarded it specifically as a disorder of the complex I of the electron transport chain (ETC). The ETC is fundamental for mitochondrial energy production which is essential for neuronal health. In the past two decades, more than 20 PD-associated genes have been identified. Some are directly involved in mitochondrial functions, such as
              PRKN, PINK1
              , and
              DJ-1
              . While other PD-associate genes, such as
              LRRK2
              ,
              SNCA
              , and
              GBA1
              , regulate lysosomal functions, lipid metabolism, or protein aggregation, some have been shown to indirectly affect the electron transport chain. The recent identification of
              CHCHD2
              and
              UQCRC1
              that are critical for functions of complex IV and complex III, respectively, provide direct evidence that PD is more than just a complex I disorder. Like UQCRC1 in preventing cytochrome
              c
              from release, functions of ETC proteins beyond oxidative phosphorylation might also contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.},
