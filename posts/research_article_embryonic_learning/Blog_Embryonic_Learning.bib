	abstract = {Most research on embryonic learning and behavior in aquatic vertebrates has focused on fitness benefits after hatching, but the ability of embryos to perceive and respond to environmental stimuli may also have immediate adaptive value. Here, we examined whether fathead minnow embryos, Pimephales promelas, detect and respond to cues indicative of predation risk, and whether the embryonic environment influences behavior after hatching. We compared the behavior of 5-day-old postfertilization (dpf) embryos reared in the presence or absence of olfactory alarm cue, alone or in combination with the cues of a piscivorous predator (Bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus). Next, we reared larvae from the embryonic treatments to 21 dpf and tested them in two antipredator behavioral assays reflecting differences in the degree of immediate risk (predator avoidance vs attack evasion). Embryos that developed under perceived high-risk conditions exhibited reduced activity compared to those from low-risk environments. Larvae from high-risk environments also showed enhanced antipredator behavior, and evidence for embryonic predator learning. These data provide new insight into the learning capabilities and antipredator behaviors of aquatic vertebrate embryos.},

These results suggest that chemical predator recognition is a result of previous experience and not genetic factors, Wild young-of-the-year minnows responded to pike odour with a response intensity that was similar to that of older fish, demonstrating that the ability to recognize predators is learned within the first year. The intensity of response of wild minnows which had been maintained in a predator free environment for 1 year was similar to that of recently caught minnows of the same age, suggesting that reinforcement was not required for predator recognition to be retained. Naive minnows that were exposed simultaneously to chemical stimuli from pike (a neutral stimulus) and minnow alarm substance exhibited a fright response upon subsequent exposure to the pike stimulus alone. Predator-naive minnows exposed simultaneously to chemical stimuli from pike and glass-distilled water did not exhibit a fright response to the pike stimulus alone.

Schizocosa responded to prey of inferior quality by developing an aversion. The number of prey encounters needed for the aversion to develop depended on the prey type and the quality of alternative prey available. As expected, fewer low-quality prey were accepted if prey of higher quality were available; however, acceptance was also reduced if alternative prey were of even lower quality. An aversion disappeared within a few hours to about 1 day. Consumption by Schizocosa of even small amounts of some “toxic” prey species reduced growth by inhibiting feeding rate and impairing utilization of food derived from prey of higher quality.

	abstract = {Insects that undergo complete metamorphosis experience enormous changes in both morphology and lifestyle. The current study examines whether larval experience can persist through pupation into adulthood in Lepidoptera, and assesses two possible mechanisms that could underlie such behavior: exposure of emerging adults to chemicals from the larval environment, or associative learning transferred to adulthood via maintenance of intact synaptic connections. Fifth instar Manduca sexta caterpillars received an electrical shock associatively paired with a specific odor in order to create a conditioned odor aversion, and were assayed for learning in a Y choice apparatus as larvae and again as adult moths. We show that larvae learned to avoid the training odor, and that this aversion was still present in the adults. The adult aversion did not result from carryover of chemicals from the larval environment, as neither applying odorants to naïve pupae nor washing the pupae of trained caterpillars resulted in a change in behavior. In addition, we report that larvae trained at third instar still showed odor aversion after two molts, as fifth instars, but did not avoid the odor as adults, consistent with the idea that post-metamorphic recall involves regions of the brain that are not produced until later in larval development. The present study, the first to demonstrate conclusively that associative memory survives metamorphosis in Lepidoptera, provokes intriguing new questions about the organization and persistence of the central nervous system during metamorphosis. Our results have both ecological and evolutionary implications, as retention of memory through metamorphosis could influence host choice by polyphagous insects, shape habitat selection, and lead to eventual sympatric speciation.},

	abstract = {Most animals begin life in eggs, protected and constrained by a capsule, shell, or other barrier. As embryos develop, their needs and abilities change, altering the costs and benefits of encapsulation, and the risks and opportunities of the outside world. When the cost/benefit ratio is better outside the egg, animals should hatch. Adaptive timing of hatching evolves in this context. However, many environmental variables affect the optimal timing of hatching so there is often no consistent best time. Across a broad range of animals, from flatworms and snails to frogs and birds, embryos hatch at different times or at different developmental stages in response to changing risks or opportunities. Embryos respond to many types of cues, assessed via different sensory modalities. Some responses appear simple. Others are surprisingly complex and sophisticated. Parents also manipulate the timing of hatching. The number and breadth of examples of cued hatching suggest that, in the absence of specific information, we should not assume that hatching timing is fixed. Our challenge now is to integrate information on the timing of hatching across taxa to better understand the diversity of patterns and how they are structured in relation to different types of environmental and developmental variation. As starting points for comparative studies, I: (1) suggest a framework based on heterokairy—individual, plastic variation in the rate, timing, or sequence of developmental events and processes—to describe patterns and mechanisms of variation in the timing of hatching; (2) briefly review the distribution of environmentally cued hatching across the three major clades of Bilateria, highlighting the diverse environmental factors and mechanisms involved; and (3) discuss factors that shape the diversity of plastic and fixed timing of hatching, drawing on evolutionary theory on phenotypic plasticity which directs our attention to fitness trade-offs, environmental heterogeneity, and predictive cues. Combining mechanistic and evolutionary perspectives is necessary because development changes organismal interactions with the environment. Integrative and comparative studies of the timing of hatching will improve our understanding of embryos as both evolving and developing organisms.},

Nevertheless, it is unknown whether generalization occurs in conjunction with this early learning process. We found that inexperienced hatchling cuttlefish preferred ‘black’ to ‘white crab’ for their first meal, the black ink envelope of cuttlefish eggs did not prevent embryos discriminating between black and white crabs and embryonic or postembryonic visual familiarization to ‘white crabs’ induced a subsequent visual preference for ‘white crabs’ over ‘black crabs’ in the hatchling's first meal. Finally, juvenile cuttlefish previously pre- or postnatally exposed to ‘white crabs’ preferred ‘black crabs’ to shrimp, indicating for the first time that prey generalization occurs as early as the embryonic stages in cuttlefish. Such cognitive abilities could confer important adaptive advantages in processing information about prey likely to be available in the egg-laying environment at hatching and in the course of juvenile dispersal.},

Embryonic learning may optimize survival by allowing for the earliest possible response to predation threats posthatch. However, predatory threats often change over an individual’s lifetime, and using old information can be detrimental if it becomes outdated. Adaptive forgetting allows an individual to discount obsolete information in decision-making and instead emphasize newer, more relevant information when responding to predation threats. Little is known about the extent to which young individuals can learn and forget information about predation threats. Here we demonstrate that rainbow trout 1) are capable of learning from both conspecific and heterospecific alarm cues as embryos, newly hatched larvae, and free-swimming larvae, 2) exhibit adaptive forgetting of predator information at all stages, and 3) display dynamic adaptive forgetting based on the ontogeny of learning. Specifically, fish that learned information as embryos retained the information for longer periods than those that learned the same information as newly hatched alevins.},

	abstract = {Predation can be a very strong selective pressure on prey. Many studies have shown the existence of innate anti-predator responses, mostly in the early developmental stages of juvenile vertebrates. Learning to recognize predators is another possible defensive resource, but such a method involves a high death risk. There is evidence that prenatal learning exists in animals but few studies have explicitly tested for embryonic learning. The aim of this study was to test innate and learned predator recognition in cuttlefish embryos. For this, naïve embryos were exposed to chemical and visual cues emanating from predators, nonpredators, and ink. Their response was assessed by measuring their ventilation rate (VR). We first show that VR decreased in response to both visual and chemical predatory cues and ink but not to non-predatory cues. Second, we show that when nonpredatory cues (visual or chemical) are paired with predatory cues or ink for several days, embryonic VR significantly decreased. Such a response is likely adaptive, especially in a translucent egg, since it results in reduced movement and hence may lower the risk of detection by visual predators. This freezing-like behavior may also reduce the bioelectric field, thus lessening the predation risk by non-visual foragers. Our results report that cuttlefish embryos had an innate capacity to differentiate between harmless and harmful chemical and visual cues. They were also capable of learning to respond to harmless cues when they were paired with danger (predator or ink) based on conditioning. The combination of these behavioral mechanisms is an example of the early adaptability of cephalopods. Such behavioral plasticity may give the newly hatched cuttlefish a selective advantage when dealing with either known or unfamiliar threats. Nevertheless, more experiments are needed to test the efficiency of the embryos’ response faced with known or new predators.},

However, it is not known whether prey animals are able to modulate their own bioelectrical signals to reduce predation risk. Here, we show that some shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum) embryos can detect predator-mimicking electric fields and respond by ceasing their respiratory gill movements. Despite being confined to the small space within the egg case, where they are vulnerable to predators, embryonic sharks are able to recognise dangerous stimuli and react with an innate avoidance response. Knowledge of such behaviours, may inform the development of effective shark repellents.},

Embryos from a range of taxa can detect predator cues and use antipredator responses to reduce risk; however, little is known about this capacity in elasmobranchs, especially regarding olfactory detection. Embryonic Port Jackson sharks (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) were exposed to elasmobranch and teleost odours across key developmental stages to investigate their capacity to detect and discern between cues. Oxygen uptake rates were measured as a proxy for antipredator response and to estimate their energetic costs. Earlier developmental stages exhibited limited responses, regardless of the odour, likely associated with an undeveloped sensory system. However, older shark embryos depressed oxygen uptake rates (i.e. crypsis responses) when exposed to teleost cues, but showed little response to elasmobranch cues. In contrast, hatchlings exhibited minimal responses to teleost cues but a significant increase in oxygen uptake rates when exposed to elasmobranch odours, indicative of a general stress response in preparation for escape. Collectively, our data suggest that embryonic sharks can differentiate between odour cues and elicit various responses, but this ability is limited by their developing sensory capacity.},

Minnows exposed to the alarm pheromone survived 39. 5\% longer than controls. This difference in survival time appeared to result not from direct inhibition of the pike but rather from some aspect of the minnows' antipredator behavior. Minnows exhibited significant increases in both shoaling and shelter use after exposure to the alarm pheromone. For control minnows, the degree of shoaling was positively correlated with survival time, suggesting that increased shoaling is an effective antipredator response. This study provides the first direct experimental evidence that chemical alarm signals in fishes improve survival of receivers.},

	abstract = {1.Ein im freien Gewässer oder im Aquarium durch Fütterung zutraulich gemachter Ellritzenschwarm zeigt eine Schreckreaktion, wenn ihm ein verletzter Artgenosse beigesellt wird. In typischen Fällen sieht man die Fische nach einer Latenzzeit von etwa 1/2 Min. zusammenschrecken, zu Boden gehen, sich eng aneinanderschließen, und dann suchen sie nach kurzer Zeit das Weite oder fliehen (im Aquarium) ins Versteck. Es kann stunden- oder tagelang dauern, bis die alte Zutraulichkeit wiederkehrt.2.Die Schreckreaktion wird durch einen Schreckstoff ausgelöst, der aus der verletzten Haut der Ellritze frei wird.3.Es spielt keine Rolle, ob die verletzte Ellritze lebend oder tot ist. Bei Fischen, die ohne Verwundung abgetötet werden, geht einige Zeit nach Eintritt des Todes der Schreckstoff auch aus der unverletzten Haut in das Wasser über.4.Der Anblick einer leblosen Ellritze löst keine Schreckreaktion aus.5.Empfindliche Schwärme reagieren noch deutlich auf einen Extrakt aus Eilritzenhaut (0,2 g Haut in 200 ccm Wasser extrahiert) bei einer Verdünnung von 1: 500. Es werden 100 ccm des verdünnten Extraktes eingegossen. Da er sich hierbei mit dem Wasser des Beckens mischt, ist der wahre Verdünnungsgrad, auf den die Fische eben noch ansprechen, erheblich größer.6.Die Schwärme sind individuell verschieden empfindlich. Ein und derselbe Schwärm reagiert bei wiederholten Versuchen mit der gleichen Verdünnungsstufe oft durchaus gleichartig, er kann sich aber auch abstumpfen oder (seltener) mit zunehmender Empfindlichkeit ansprechen.7.Man erhält durchschnittlich bessere Reaktionen: in kleineren Becken, an länger eingewöhnten oder langsam zutraulich gewordenen Schwärmen. Ohne deutlichen Einfluß auf die Reaktionsbereitschaft sind die Herkunft und das Alter der Fische, die den Schwärm zusammensetzen, und die Jahreszeit.8.Auch der Schreckstoffgehalt der Haut zeigt bei Ellritzen verschiedener Herkunft, verschiedenen Alters oder verschiedenen Geschlechtes keine wesentlichen Unterschiede.9.In einer mehrmonatlichen Hungerzeit sinkt der Schreckstoffgehalt der Ellritzenhaut auf etwa 1/4.10.Es besteht kein nennenswerter Unterschied im Schreckstoffgehalt zwischen der dunklen Rückenhaut und der nur mit rotem Pigment und Guanin ausgestatteten Bauchhaut der Ellritze.11.Im Darm und in der Leber der Ellritze läßt sich kein Schreckstoff nachweisen. Die Ovarien sind etwa 100fach, die Muskeln 20fach, die Kiemenblättchen 5–10fach weniger wirksam als die Haut. Die relativ starke Wirksamkeit der Kiemenblättchen ist wohl auf ihren Epithelüberzug zurückzuführen.12.Nach Ausschaltung des Geruchsinnes reagieren die Ellritzen auch auf unverdünnten Ellritzenhautextrakt nicht mehr. Der Schreckstoff ist also ein Riechstoff. Kontrollversuche zeigen, daß die Reaktionsbereitschaft an sich durch die Operation nicht leidet.13.Die Haut toter Ellritzen behält mehrere Tage ihre Wirksamkeit.14.Nach den Untersuchungen R. Hüttels über die chemische Natur des Schreckstoffes aus der Ellritzenhaut scheint es sich um purin- oder pterinähnliche Stoffe zu handeln. Da sie wasserlöslich, aber nicht flüchtig sind, liegt eine Substanz vor, die für Fische ein Riechstoff ist, aber für uns als solcher nicht in Frage kommt.15.Es wurden die Häute von 41 Süβwasserfischarten auf ihre Wirksamkeit im Vergleich mit der Ellritzenhaut geprüft. Die Ergebnisse sind in Tabelle 18 (S. 120) übersichtlich zusammengestellt. 18 Arten gehören in andere Familien als die Ellritze. Ihre Häute enthalten keine nennenswerten Mengen eines für Ellritzen wirksamen Schreckstoffes (relativer Wirkungsgrad im Höchstfalle 1/100). Die Haut der Familienangehörigen (Cypriniden) war im allgemeinen wirksam, doch erreichen nur 2 von den 23 geprüften Arten angenähert den Wirkungsgrad der Ellritzenhaut. Für die starken Unterschiede im relativen Wirkungsgrad der Haut auch innerhalb der Familie der Cypriniden (vgl. Tabelle 18) sind neben dem Verwandtschaftsgrad offenbar noch andere Umstände maßgebend.16.Fluβbarsche (Fam. Percidae) zeigen keine Schreckreaktion, auch nicht auf die Haut (oder andere Körperteile) von Artgenossen.17.Aitel, Bitterlinge und Rotfedern (Fam. Cyprinidae) zeigen eine deutliche Schreckreaktion auf den Hautextrakt von Artgenossen.18.Ellritzen sprechen auf den Hautextrakt von ihresgleichen stärker an als auf den Hautextrakt von Bitterlingen und Rotfedern. Da auch Bitterlinge und Rotfedern auf den Hautextrakt der Artgenossen am stärksten reagieren, muß entweder der Schreckstoff bei verschiedenen Arten qualitativ verschieden oder neben dem Schreckstoff auch der charakteristische Artduft der Fische für die Intensität der Schreckreaktion mitbestimmend sein.19.Nach anderweitigen Beobachtungen und Versuchen gibt es eine Schreckreaktion wahrscheinlich auch bei der Plötze, dem Gründling, der Laube, dem Schneider und der Orfe (durchwegs heimische Cypriniden) und sicher bei dem indischen Cypriniden Danio malabaricus.20.Eine Schreckreaktion der geschilderten Art ist also bisher nur von gesellig lebenden Friedfischen bekannt. Ihre biologische Bedeutung liegt offenbar darin, daß bei einem räuberischen Überfall der aus der verletzten Haut eines gepackten Fisches frei werdende Schreckstoff die Kameraden warnt,21.Es läßt sich zeigen, daß beim Verschlingen einer Ellritze durch einen Hecht tatsächlich Warnstoffmengen frei werden, die hinreichen, um einen Ellritzenschwarm stark und nachhaltig zu verschrecken.22.Die Reaktionsbereitschaft der Ellritzen wird in der Regel gesteigert, wenn sie nicht nur den Schreckstoff, sondern gleichzeitig einen Hecht geruchlich wahrnehmen.23.Bei Freilandversuchen ist die Schreckwirkung auffällig an den Ort des Schreckerlebnisses gebunden. Während sich die Fische an dieser Stelle durch Futter nicht anlocken lassen, nehmen sie es einige Meter abseits ohne Scheu.24.Aber auch dort ist ihr Gehaben nach einem Schreckerlebnis verändert. Sie sind von gesteigerter Wachsamkeit und reagieren mit Auge, Ohr und Nase auch auf unbedeutende Veränderungen, die sie vorher nicht beachtet haben.25.Zweimal wurde eine Schreckreaktion unter natürlichen Bedingungen beobachtet: an einem Ellritzenschwarm, aus dem ein Barsch ein geschwächtes Tier herausholte, und an einem Laubenschwarm, aus dem eine Rohrdommel einen Fisch wegschnappte, der ihr wieder entkam.26.Die Gewohnheit wehrloser Friedfische, sich zu Schwärmen zu vereinigen, wird nun besser verständlich; denn bei einem räuberischen Überfall kann bei geselligem Leben der Warnstoff für die Allgemeinheit von Vorteil, ja von lebensrettender Bedeutung sein.},

A competitive male always attacks female intruders, whereas he initially displays to intruding males. Territorial rivals, though not egg predators, may try to usurp his nest. Successful competitive nest holders may appear more robust than their true condition and thereby prevent eviction by newly reproductive male intruders. Such newcomers preferentially attack residents in relatively poor condition and pale coloration.},

Onset of breeding season was marked by transition from schooling to territoriality among mature males. "Territorial objects" were vigorously contacted by males. Intruders of territory were attacked, but there was no repertoire of threat displays. Characteristics of fighting between males are described. Territoriality provided individual males with an area in which mating and parental care could proceed relatively undisturbed. A male might spawn with 1 or more females. The spawning act is described in detail. In aquaria newly hatched fry received no apparent care and were eventually eaten by the male parents. Relationships were found between behavior and morphology in the fishes. Vigorous contact movement may be regarded as general territorial behavior occurring throughout the breeding system.

	abstract = {Organisms are exposed to a wealth of chemical information during their development. Some of these chemical cues indicate present or future dangers, such as the presence of predators that feed on either the developing embryos or their nearby parents. Organisms may use this information to modify their morphology or life-history, including hatching timing, or may retain information about risk until it gains relevance. Previous research has shown predation-induced alterations in hatching among embryonic minnows that were exposed to mechanical-injury-released alarm cues from conspecific embryos. Here, we test whether minnows likewise hatch early in response to alarm cues from injured adult conspecifics. We know that embryonic minnows can detect adult alarm cues and use them to facilitate learned recognition of predators; however, it is unknown whether these adult alarm cues will also induce a change in hatching time. Early hatching may allow animals to rapidly disperse away from potential predators, but late hatching may allow animals to grow and develop structures that allow them to effectively escape when they do hatch. Here, we found here that unlike embryonic fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to embryonic cues, embryonic minnows exposed to adult alarm cues do not exhibit early hatching. The ability of embryos to recognize adult alarm cues as a future threat, but not a current one, demonstrates sophisticated ontogenetic specificity in the hatching response of embryonic minnows.},

With visual cues alone, there was no significant discrimination of shoalmates. A second set of trials was conducted to ensure that minnows were choosing natural shoalmates and not just individuals with which they were held in the laboratory. When given the choice between unfamiliar conspecifics and shoalmates from which they were separated for a minimum of two months, minnows exhibited a significant preference for shoalmates. Taken together, these data suggest that fathead minnows are able to discriminate among conspecifics on the basis of familiarity using chemosensory cues, even after a relatively long separation. The ability to discriminate among conspecifics may facilitate: (1) the maintenance of kin groups or groups that share similar foraging or predator avoidance patterns or (2) the recognition of former shoalmates after some period of separation.},
