## Getting started

It's been a while since I have been trying to find various productivity softwares to prepare myself for my future PhD journey. One of those tasks which I wanted to automate was in organizing my scientific literature collection. The answer to organizing and annotating the literature was met by two softwares; Zotero and Notion. Zotero is a free to use reference manager that can be used to organize your literature collection with ease. Notion on the other hand is a productivity software which can used as a workspace manager, task manager and into many other things. I have written a [guide](https://one-carat-blog.netlify.app/posts/notion_literature/) on how one can use Zotero and Notion to build a literature tracker.

Now that the organization part is taken care of, I wanted to have a software which can help me take notes on those literature. Now you can write notes and embed them into the .pdf file using Zotero, or use Notion to create notes using the literature base which are synced with the Zotero libraries. Both these methods work, but I wanted something versatile. And that's what brought me to **Obsidian**, an open source, free to use, note taking software that uses the Markdown language at its core. In this blog post I will show you how I use Obsidian to take literature notes. 

## Using Obsidian with Zotero

Before we begin, the picture given below shows my Obsidian interface. The interface is broken down to different panels, where each panel shows a specific info.

In this blog post I will show you how you can use Obsidian. along with Zotero to take notes. Now the primary goal for me in using Obsidian is to write summaries of the literature that I am studying, but at the same time, you can also so use it as a research diaries and as a general note taking software to write your thoughts and ideas. So let us get started!

### Setting up Obsidian

We will first see how to create the interface that we saw earlier. For that let us first install Obsidian. 

1.    Installing Obsidian is very easy. Just visit their official [website](https://obsidian.md/) and download the version suited for your operating system. I assume that you already have Zotero in your computer. If not, then please visit [here](https://www.zotero.org/) and download the appropriate version for your system. Now that we have both Obsidian and Zotero, let us get started.

One good things about Obsidian is that you do not need an active internet connection to use it and also the markdown files that you will be making will be saved locally. 

2.    When you first open Obsidian, it will ask you to create a vault. The vault is a folder location which will contain all the markdown files you will be creating. After you have selected a vault location, you will opening interface would be something like this;

### Setting up Zotero

Now before we proceed, let us configure Zotero. We will use Zotero to create a BibTeX file from a library. Now this .bib file will contains all the metadata of the literature present in that library. But we wont be making a normal .bib file, instead we will use a plugin called 'Better BibTeX for Zotero' to make the .bib file, which feature an auto update feature. What it means is that, as you add in more literature to your Zotero library, the .bib file will automatically gets updated. Pretty cool right?

3.    Download the 'Better BibTeX for Zotero' plugin from [here](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases/tag/v6.7.36). Hover your cursor to 
`zotero-better-bibtex-6.7.36.xpi`, then right click and select 'Save link as' to download the addon.

4.    Then open up Zotero and navigate to Tools -> Add-ons. Then go the setting options by clicking on the gear icon and then select 'Install add-on from file'. Browse to the location where your file was downloaded and then install the addon.

5.    Let us now configure the plugin. Select Edit -> Preferences -> Better BibTex. In the 'Citation key format' section replace the given text to following: `authEtal2+year`. This will change the citation key to 'author name + year' format which is much more useful and easy to understand the default citation key format. You can visit [here](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/citing/) to learn more about how to customize your citation key format.

Finally, select the folder which you want to make a .bib file for. If you want to access all the literature files from the Zotero library, then export the .bib file from 'My library'.

6.    Right click on 'My library' and then click on 'Export library'. A small windows will pop up, select 'Better BibLaTeX' from the format option. Check the 'Keep updated' option, this will auto update the .bib file when you add new files to the Zotero library. You can also check the 'Export notes' option if you want to export the highlights and annotation that you have made on the .pdf files using Zotero.

7.    Save your .bib file in a location of your choice. Then copy the full path (file location) to the .bib file. We will be needing this shortly.

### Installing plugins in Obsidian

Now you might be wondering why your Obsidian interface is not looking the same as mine. This because I use a few plugins to enable some extra features. Now Obsidian features an awesome community that make hundreds of plugins, enabling an element of versatility to the note taking experience. We will be using a few of these plugins. So let us download our first plugin for Obsidian.

1.    Installing plugins in Obsidian is super easy. Select the 'settings' tab in the bottom-left section and then select the 'Community plugins' option. Select 'Turn on community plugins' option. Then click on 'Browse' and search for the plugin named 'Citations' and install it and then enable it.

2.    Then go to 'Options' section of the plugin. We need to do a few things here. Choose the 'Citation database format' as `BibLaTex`. Then paste the .bib file location to the 'Citation database path' which we copied earlier. Also make a new folder in your Obsidian vault folder. This folder will be used to create .md files of the literature that you will be accessing in Obsidian via Zotero. Paste the name of that folder in the 'Literature note folder' section.

Now you can go one step more to customize your literature note and make it look pretty. By default Obsidian support call-out blocks. But with the help of the plugin; 'Admonition' you can make custom callout blocks.

3.    Search and install the community plugin 'Admonition'. Then configure and add in new callout blocks in plugin options. I made three custom blocks; Title (title), Year (year) and Authors (authors). The word given in the brackets are what is used to call the blocks. So to input the callout block for the title, you can use the following syntax; `>[!title]`.

To the access the plugin in the note window, press `Ctrl+P` to open up the commands menu. Type 'Citations' and view the different options. Otherwise you can quickly access the citation menu by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+E` instead. Then you can browse through your library collection and search for the literature that you want. By selecting a literature entry, a markdown file (.md file) will be automatically be created to your 'Literature note folder'. You can open these markdown files and then make necessary edits. I personally use them to write the summary and my understanding of that paper in the .md file.
