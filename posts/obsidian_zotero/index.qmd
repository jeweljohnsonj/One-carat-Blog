## Getting started

It's been a while since I have been trying to find various productivity software to prepare myself for my future Ph.D. journey. One of those tasks which I wanted to automate was in organizing my scientific literature collection. The answer to organizing and annotating the literature was met by two software; Zotero and Notion. Zotero is a free-to-use reference manager that can organize your literature collection with ease. Notion, on the other hand, is a productivity software that can be used as a workspace manager, task manager, and many other things. I have written a [guide](https://one-carat-blog.netlify.app/posts/notion_literature/) on how one can use Zotero and Notion to build a literature tracker.

Now that the organization part is taken care of, I was in search of software that can help me take summary notes on the literature that I am studying. Now I can write notes and embed them into the .pdf file using Zotero itself or use Notion to create notes using the literature database which is synced with the Zotero libraries. Both these methods work, but I wanted something versatile. And that's what brought me to **Obsidian**, an open-source, free-to-use, note-taking software that uses the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) language at its core. In this blog post, I will show you how I use Obsidian to take literature notes. 

## Using Obsidian with Zotero

Before we begin, the picture given below shows my Obsidian interface. The interface is broken down into different panels, where each panel shows specific info.

![Different sections of the interface](images/obsidian_interface_inkscape.svg){group="elsewhere"
description="Each section functions or displays a specific info which can enhance the note-taking experience"}
:::

Now the primary goal for me in using Obsidian is to write summary notes of the papers that I am reading, but at the same time, I can also so use it as a research diary and as a general note-taking software to write my thoughts and ideas. One good thing about Obsidian is that you don't need an active internet connection to use it and also the markdown files that you will be making will be saved locally. So let us get started!

### Setting up Obsidian

We will first see how to create the interface that we saw earlier. For that let us first install Obsidian. 

1.    Installing Obsidian is very easy. Just visit their official [website](https://obsidian.md/) and download the version suited for your operating system. I assume that you already have Zotero on your computer. If not, then please visit [here](https://www.zotero.org/) and download the appropriate version for your system. Now that we have both Obsidian and Zotero, let us get started.

![Initial message after opening Obsidian for the first time](images/obsidian_first.png){#fig-start}

When you first open Obsidian, it will ask you to create a vault as shown in the @fig-start below. The vault is a folder location that will contain all the markdown files you will be creating. Now instead of doing everything from scratch, for convenience, I will be sharing my vault [template](https://github.com/jeweljohnsonj/obsidian_template) folder so that you can get started quickly. The folder will also contain the necessary plugins and configurations to jump-start your Obsidian journey. 

2.    Download the folder as a zip file from [here](https://github.com/jeweljohnsonj/obsidian_template/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

3.    Extract the zip file and open the folder in Obsidian using 'Open folder as vault' as shown in @fig-start. If done properly, then you will get the following interface as shown in the image below.

![Vault template interface](images/vault_folder.png)

I use the following plugins which are not owned or made by me. The credits go to the plugin developers. You can learn more about the plugins by following their GitHub repo links.

1.    [Obsidian Admonition](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-admonition)
2.    [Autocomplete Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/yeboster/autocomplete-obsidian)
3.    [Better Word Count](https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count)
4.    [obsidian-calendar-plugin](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin)
5.    [obsidian-citation-plugin](https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin)
6.    [cMenu Plugin](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/cMenu-Plugin)
7.    [Obsidian Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)
8.    [Obsidian Icon Folder](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-icon-folder)
9.    [Obsidian Pandoc Reference List](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-pandoc-reference-list)

### Setting up Zotero

Now before we proceed, let us configure Zotero. We will use Zotero to create a BibTeX file from a library. Now, this .bib file will contain all the metadata of the literature present in that library. But we won't be making a normal .bib file, instead, we will use a plugin called 'Better BibTeX for Zotero' to make the .bib file, which features an auto-update feature. What it means is that, as you add more literature to your Zotero library, the .bib file will automatically update. Pretty cool right?

1.    Download the 'Better BibTeX for Zotero' plugin from [here](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases/tag/v6.7.36). Hover your cursor to 
`zotero-better-bibtex-6.7.36.xpi`, then right-click and select 'Save link as' to download the addon.

2.    Then open up Zotero and navigate to Tools -> Add-ons. Then go to the setting options by clicking on the gear icon and then select 'Install add-on from file'. Browse to the location where your file was downloaded and then install the addon.

3.    Let us now configure the plugin. Select Edit -> Preferences -> Better BibTex. In the 'Citation key format' section replace the existing text with the following: `authEtal2+year`.

![My zotero BibTex citation key format](images/zotero_bib.png)

This will change the citation key to the 'author name + year' format which is much more useful and easy to understand than the default citation key format. You can visit [here](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/citing/) to learn more about how to customize your citation key format.

Finally, select the folder which you want to make a .bib file for. If you want to access all the literature files from the Zotero library, then export the .bib file from 'My library'.

4. Right-click on 'My library' and then click on 'Export library'. A small window will pop up, select 'Better BibLaTeX' from the format option. Check the 'Keep updated' option, this will auto-update the .bib file when you add new files to the Zotero library. You can also check the 'Export notes' option if you want to export the highlights and annotations that you have made on the .pdf files using Zotero.

5.    Save your .bib file in a location of your choice. Then copy the full path (file location) to the .bib file. We will be needing this shortly.

### Configuring the plugins

As you are using my template, you don't have to individually download the plugins which I am using. But you do need to configure a few settings (only two configurations). Let us configure the 'Citations' plugin first.

1.    Go to the setting page in Obsidian. Then under 'Community plugins' select the 'Citations' plugin. Then in the 'Citation database path' paste your .bib file path.

As an example my .bib file location is the following; `/home/jewel/Downloads/Example.bib`

![Citations plugin option](images/citations_option.png)

The syntax of the citations template that I am using is the following;

```
---
title: "{{title}}"
authors: {{authorString}}
year: {{year}}
citekey: {{citekey}}
---

>[!title]
{{title}}

>[!year]
{{year}}

>[!author]
{{authorString}}

------------------------------------

URL: {{URL}}

Zotero link:  [@{{citekey}}]({{zoteroSelectURI}})

tags::

```
You can visit the official GitHub [repo](https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin) of the Citations plugin or read the instructions shown in the plugin window in Obsidian to learn more about how to customize the template.

You also need to configure the 'Pandoc Reference List' plugin. To use this plugin you would need the `pandoc` package installed on your computer. Most operating systems have it pre-installed and if you don't have it then please visit [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) for info on how to install the package. For Linux users, you can install 'pandoc' using your package manager by searching.

1.    Head on to the 'Pandoc Reference List' plugin under the 'Community plugins' section. In 'Path to Bibliography File' section, paste the same path location as before (i.e. the location of your .bib file).

### Using the citation plugin

To access the plugin in the note window, press `Ctrl+P` to open up the commands menu. Type 'Citations' and view the different options. For quick access, you can press `Ctrl+Shift+E` instead and browse through your library collection and search for the literature that you want to reference.

![Citation plugin hotkeys](images/citation_hotkeys.png)

By selecting a literature entry, a markdown file (.md file) will be automatically created in your 'Literature_collection' folder. You can open these markdown files and then make the necessary edits. I use them to write the summary and my understanding of that paper in the .md file.

I have also made a literature table using the 'Dataview' plugin. You can configure the source code of the table to suit your needs. 

The source code is as follows;

````
```dataview
table title, authors, year, tags
from "Literature_collection"
sort year desc
```
````

You can learn more about how to configure the table [here](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview).

## Conlusion

I have just started out using Obsidian and so far I have had an amazing experience. There are a lot of community plugins available and I get easily overwhelmed by them. You can browse the plugins collection and see what fits your interests. I hope you find this guide helpful and let me know in the comments about your experience with Obsidian.
