## Using Notion as a task management dashboard

With the ability to make databases, Notion becomes an excellent tool to manage day to day tasks. In this article I am going to give you a quick tour on how you can use Notion as a task management dashboard, with the templates I made. Specifically I made four templates where each template serves a specific function.

You can copy my template by duplicating it to your Notion database. The link to my templates is [here](https://jeweljohnson.notion.site/Template-PhD-Dashboard-136e837c4f0b4e61bc34e2aad7fb05b5). Through this link you will get my entire template collection. For now we will only be interested in templates related to task management.
