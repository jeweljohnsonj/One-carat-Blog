## Using Notion as a task management dashboard

With the ability to make databases, Notion becomes an excellent tool to manage task lists. In this article I am going to give you a quick tour on how you can use Notion as a task management dashboard with the templates I made.

There are four templates to add to your Notion database and you need all four of them to function properly.

1. [To-do-list](https://jeweljohnson.notion.site/22735f3cfabd4e34b1a38cc2127c5202?v=8a3317915d4a4a9b97448ae74a9942bf): Acts as the master database where all tasks are stored. By default only shows incomplete tasks.
2. [Completed task list](https://jeweljohnson.notion.site/0423a149b5274574adb7d123665c8579?v=4743a4b9a12a45a992deebd972047ea9): Same template as above, but only tasks that are completed are shown. Act as an archive for completed tasks.
3. [Task manager](https://jeweljohnson.notion.site/Task-manager-246a1b4e5b4a4f1b846da8e42b5af756): Task manager interface where each tasks are arranged and displayed categorically. By default only shows incomplete tasks.
4. [Task dashboard](https://jeweljohnson.notion.site/Task-dashboard-195e0f63dbd94f518918f78708677e60): A dashboard which informs you which tasks are due and how long are they due to completion.
