## Welcome to One Carat Blog

My name is Jewel Johnson and I am the founder of this blog. I write articles mostly related to R programming. The blog was first made using the `distill` package in R. Eventually the blog was remade using the new `quarto` package. If you are a beginner and wants to learn R programming, check out my **R tutorials** section in the navigation bar. Hope you enjoy the blog.
