## Very important message

Everyone please note that I am moving away from GitHub pages to Netifly to deploy my blog. Therefore please use the [new link](https://one-carat-blog.netlify.app/) to visit this blog.


To check if you are using the new link, while seeing this message, please look at the link in your browser. If it is `https://one-carat-blog.netlify.app/` then no worries. But if it is `https://jeweljohnsonj.github.io/one-carat-blog/`, then you are using the old link. Please use the [new link](https://one-carat-blog.netlify.app/). Thank you for your support.

I will retire the GitHub page link in the coming weeks.

## Welcome to One Carat Blog

My name is Jewel Johnson and I am an aspiring ecologist who is interested in behaviour, vision and in the effect of human activities on animals (especially insects). I did my master's in Biology from the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/) (IISER-TVM). My master's thesis was on understanding the **Visual ecology of the giant honeybee (*Apis dorsata*)** under the guidance of [Prof. Hema Somanathan](https://faculty.iisertvm.ac.in/beelab/) at IISER-TVM .

## Current status

**Currently, I am looking for research labs to join for a PhD** üòá

I made this blog using the [quarto](https://quarto.org/) package. My blog posts are generally focused on science communication and R programming. I also believe that teaching is the best way to learn anything, so I make extensive tutorials on the things I learn. You can find them all in the 'Tutorials' section in the navigation bar. Hope you like my blog ‚ò∫Ô∏è
