## Welcome to One Carat Blog

My name is Jewel Johnson and I am an aspiring ecologist who is interested in behaviour, vision and in the effect of human activities on animals (especially insects). I did my master's in Biology from the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/) (IISER-TVM). My master's thesis was on understanding the **Visual ecology of the giant honeybee (*Apis dorsata*)** under the guidance of [Prof. Hema Somanathan](https://faculty.iisertvm.ac.in/beelab/) at IISER-TVM . Currently, I am looking for research labs to join for a PhD ðŸ˜‡

I made this blog using the [quarto](https://quarto.org/) package. My blog posts are generally focused on science communication and R programming. I have written a tutorial series on data visualization and data manipulation using R and, also on understanding basic statistics using R. Thanks for visiting my blog ðŸ™Œ
