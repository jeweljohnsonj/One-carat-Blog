## Welcome to One Carat Blog

My name is Jewel Johnson and I am the creator of this blog. I finished my master's in Biology from the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/). My research interests are in but are not limited to, behavioural ecology, visual ecology, social behaviour and understanding the effect of human activities on animals. Currently, I am looking for research labs to join for a PhD. You might find me dropping in ice-cold mails to you, seeking a graduate position. So I hope my prospective supervisor is looking at this blog ðŸ˜‡

I made this blog using the **quarto** package in R. I write about science and R-programming articles. I love R programming, so I have written a tutorial series on data visualization and data manipulation using R. I have also written a small series of articles focusing on understanding basic statistics using R. Thanks for visiting my blog ðŸ™Œ
