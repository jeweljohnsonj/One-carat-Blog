Hey there! My name is Jewel Johnson, and this is my blog showcasing my journey in exploring science. I am interested in studying animal behavior and am currently an incoming PhD student at Ball State University in Indiana, where I will be studying embryonic social learning in fathead minnow fish.

*   [Past] I completed my Master's in Biology from the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/) (IISER-TVM). My Master's thesis was on understanding the visual ecology of the giant honeybee (Apis dorsata), under the guidance of [Prof. Hema Somanathan](https://faculty.iisertvm.ac.in/beelab/) at IISER-TVM.

*   [Future] I am now an incoming PhD student in [Dr. Jessica Ward's lab](https://www.animalbehaviorlab.com/) at [Ball State University](https://www.bsu.edu/) and will be studying embryonic social learning using the fathead minnow as a model organism.

I created this blog using the [quarto](https://quarto.org/) package. My blog posts generally focus on science communication and R programming. I also believe that teaching refines one's ability to learn and comprehend. Therefore, I document my learning experience by writing extensive tutorials on the topics I am learning. You can find them in the "Tutorials" section in the navigation bar.
