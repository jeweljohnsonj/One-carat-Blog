Hey there! My name is Jewel Johnson, and this is my blog showcasing my journey in exploring science.

I am interested in studying animal behavior and am curious to know how and why animals behave in a certain way. Currently, I am a PhD student in [Dr. Jessica Ward's lab](https://www.animalbehaviorlab.com/) at [Ball State University](https://www.bsu.edu/), where I will be studying embryonic learning using the fathead minnow fish.

I completed a dual degree program in biological sciences at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/) (IISER-TVM), earning both my bachelor's and master's degrees. During my master's thesis, I worked in [Prof. Hema Somanathan's lab](https://faculty.iisertvm.ac.in/beelab/) at IISER-TVM, investigating how the giant honeybee (*Apis dorsata*) is able to forage during the twilight period despite having day-adapted apposition eyes.

I created this blog using the [quarto](https://quarto.org/) package. My blog posts primarily focus on science communication and R programming. Additionally, I firmly believe that teaching refines one's ability to learn and comprehend. Therefore, I document my learning experiences by writing extensive tutorials on the topics I am studying. You can find them in the "Tutorials" section on the navigation bar.
