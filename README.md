![One carat blog](https://github.com/jeweljohnsonj/one-carat-blog/blob/main/github_read.png?raw=true)

Source files for the personal blog of Jewel Johnson made using the [quarto](https://quarto.org/) package in R.

An [earlier version](https://jeweljohnsonj.github.io/jeweljohnson.github.io/) of the blog was made using the [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) package which was later remade to the current version.
